            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And though the ſingleneſs Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> appears in, be a juſt motive to us to ſlight his new ſtampt Divinity, eſpecially ſince it conſiſts of little more then meer Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; yet he was oppoſed with ſuch ſtrength of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that I ſee he is loath to encounter it, but in that New way of Poſtſcripting Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> taught him, <hi>viz.</hi> To Anſwer Books by general Negations.

And in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it had been more Conſonant to the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation he beſpeaks, (not only from us, but from thoſe Paedobaptiſts, that hold up that practice upon grounds different from his) to have publiſhed his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in an intire Tract, then thus by parcels.

            </head>
            <p>I Shall begin with his large <hi>Preface</hi> of about 46 pages: Wherein he ſayes page 7. <hi>That if he errs, it is</hi> cum rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one. To which I ſay, that <hi>errour</hi> is too often diſguiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the plauſible ſhew and ſemblance of truth, and ſome man have the art ſo to paint it. But inſtead of making it therefore reaſonable, it is rendered the more pernicions; in as much as 'tis ſo much the more likely to inſnare and deceive; And Satan is never more capable to do miſchief, then when he is transformed into an Angel of Light. Therefore Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> had need be wary, leſt what he goes about to eſtabliſh, be found in the great day, to be no part <hi>of the Doctrine once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Saints.</hi> For then an <hi>erravi cum rations,</hi> will ſcarce be ſufficient to anſwer that Queſtion; <hi>Who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this at your hands?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preface p. 14. Mr <hi>Whiſton</hi> aſſigns 6 cauſes of our Rejecting Infant Baptiſm, the ſubſtance of which are. 1. <hi>Want of tender affections towards Relations.</hi> 2. <hi>Confounding either ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or real irregularities in the adminiſtration, with the practice.</hi> 3 <hi>Not conſidering the true Reaſon of primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Baptiſme at Age.</hi> 4. <hi>Our comparing the little good, and ſmall advantage accruing to believers ſeed, with the variety of inconveniences, and ill conſequences of</hi> Paedo-baptiſt Doctrine. 5. <hi>Placing too much of our Religion in an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way and mode.</hi> 6. <hi>By prepoſterous enquiries after the will of Chriſt, as not taking our riſe from the Covenant made with</hi> Abraham,</p>
            <p>To the <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſay, that as Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> only ſpeaks his thoughts without proof, ſo little more needs be ſaid in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of it; ſave to tell him that it is not ſo. We have as much <hi>natural love</hi> to our Children as any I preſume that oppoſe us: and we look upon that as no inſtance of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, to <hi>croſs</hi> our Lords <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> (which ſhould be more dear to us, then that <hi>Imaginary fondneſs</hi> he talks of) in <hi>Communicating</hi> an <hi>Ordinance</hi> to them, that's not <hi>appointed</hi> for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. VVe have produced our Arguments (even ſuch as we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30081:11"/>find unanſwerable) againſt the <hi>Pedo baptiſts mode</hi> of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and the ſubjects they apply Baptiſm to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 2 <hi>d</hi> particular is frivolous.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We make the New Teſtament Scripture our warrant in the practice of New Teſtament Duties and Ordinances; and the primitive Chriſtian's exact conformity is the beſt <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>comment</hi> upon the precepts there; and ought to be our pattern VVe find neither expreſs nor Conſequential warrant for Baptizing Infants there. For,</p>
            <p>A neceſſary conſequence is that which proves the matter concluded certainly ſo to be. Yea, <hi>certe ita eſſe, nec aliter ſe habere paſſe.</hi> There muſt be <hi>tam neceſſarius nexus, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolubilis aependentia,</hi> ſuch an infallible dependance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>ſubject</hi> and <hi>predicate,</hi> that the <hi>concluſion</hi> muſt be <hi>univerſally</hi> and <hi>perpetually</hi> true. And every neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence demonſtrates <hi>à priori;</hi> For, <hi>Demonſtratio eſt ex prioribus, notioribus, &amp; cauſis. A poſteriori</hi> only the diſcovery of habits is made. Now we never yet could find a <hi>Medium</hi> in Scripture that proves Infant Baptiſm (nor that they have any qualification that Intitles them to it) by any <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> in the true, <hi>logical,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> notion of it. 1. No acts of <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>repentance</hi> can be ſeen in them. 2. Nor any diſcovery of <hi>gracious habits.</hi> 2. Nor yet can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that they have <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> any intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, till at years, and capable to profeſs and act faith. Though, for ought we know, they may <hi>(in foro Dei)</hi> be inviſible members of the myſtical body of Chriſt, and in a capacity of ſalvation, through the preſentment of that ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, <hi>the free gift coming upon all,</hi> Rom. 5:18. Yet that being uncertain of any <hi>Individual,</hi> can be no ground for Baptiſm. And how can we without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a moſt dreadful breach of charity, exempt dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from the benefit of that grace, they having by no <hi>actual</hi> ſins barred themſelves from its <hi>ſaving</hi> communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And what Scripture can be produced that any one is damned meerly for the non-application of a Sacrament (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it to be not contemned) I can no where find. <hi>Urſinus</hi> tells us in his <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> that it is not the want, but the contempt of the Sacraments damns, <hi>Privatio Sacramenti non damnat, ſi non accedat contemptus, Chriſtus non adimit ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30081:11"/>
            <p>The Conſequences produced for Infant Baptiſm, we find to be <hi>ſophiſtical wretched Non-ſequitur's,</hi> and againſt the rules of that <hi>Logick,</hi> ſo celebrated by the <hi>Authors</hi> that make them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewiſh high-Prieſthood,</hi> will prove a <hi>high-Prieſthood</hi> now, by as good Conſequence of the <hi>faederal</hi> right, then, proves a <hi>faederal</hi> right now. And the <hi>Paſſover</hi> being <hi>to be taken and eaten,</hi> Exod. 12.4. <hi>according to the number of jouls in the houſe, and by every one according to his eating</hi> (and therefore by Children) will afford a conſequence of Infants <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>Supper,</hi> as valid, as that drawn from their <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> to their <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that indeed there is no <hi>Birth-holineſs</hi> now (that being a <hi>legal</hi> priviledge aboliſht, and not <hi>comporting</hi> with the Goſpel) is unanſwerably evident by this Argument.</p>
            <p>If the legal <hi>commoneſs</hi> and <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> of ſome <hi>meats, Fleſh, Birds, Beaſts, Perſons</hi> and their <hi>natural ſeed</hi> above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be taken away; then the legal <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>cleanneſs</hi> of ſome <hi>meats, Fleſh, Birds, Beaſts, Perſons</hi> and their <hi>natural ſeed</hi> above others, is alſo taken away. But the Antecedent is true; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is undenyable from theſe received Maxims, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariorum eadem eſt ratio:</hi> And <hi>Contrariorum uno ſublato, tolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur alterum,</hi> viz. <hi>Of Contrary's take away one, and the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remain in its oppoſition to it any longer.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is evident from <hi>Act.</hi> 10.11, to 28, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.2 to 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. to 28. But to the matter</p>
            <p>VVe find the true reaſons of the <hi>primitive</hi> Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptzed at <hi>age,</hi> to be, becauſe they durſt not <hi>recede</hi> from the <hi>Rule.</hi> And that's our reaſon for practicing as they did.</p>
            <p n="4">4. VVe know no advantage accruing to Infants from their Baptiſm, it makes them in your own eſteem <hi>nominal,</hi> not <hi>real</hi> Members of the viſible Church. And the name without the nature is worthleſs. And the <hi>abſurdities</hi> and <hi>inconveniencies</hi> of that practice are obvious in our VVritings. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> Church muſt conſiſt of <hi>living Stones,</hi> at leaſt ſuch as (to our cognizance) <hi>profeſs</hi> ſo to be, not <hi>ignorant</hi> Babes <hi>untransform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> out of their natural ſtate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That we place too much of our Religion in an external mode,</hi> is falſe ſuggeſtion, not to be made out by Mr. <hi>Whiſtons</hi> Logick. VVe profeſs to worſhip God <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi>

            <p n="1">1ſt. The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> in its own nature, ſingly or univerſally conſidered.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. The <hi>manner</hi> of its <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> according to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſignification, it ſignifies the great Myſtery of the mercy of God in Chriſt, wherein the Father hath eſtabliſht <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his Son, the head of all things, and given him a bleſſed ſeed of the ſons of men, to be by him, and with him, Heirs of the glorious Inheritance of the Grace of God, and the bleſſed Conſequences thereof, againſt all poſſibility of miſcarriage, according to his eternal purpoſe. This Covenant was at firſt publiſhed <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. 'tis ſpoken of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42. and 49. This is the <hi>Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> ſtill <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame,</hi> immutable from Everlaſting to Everlaſting. This Covenant was at ſundry times, and after divers manners, under divers <hi>Signes, Figures, Types, Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>Propheſies,</hi> renewed and ratified with the bleſſed Patriarchs <hi>Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Sem, Melchiſedeck,</hi> and with the Fathers <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> before the coming of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And brought to light, and revealed in all the Myſteries of it by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth, and ſhall continue <hi>without Change,</hi> to the worlds end. This Covenant hath <hi>one ſpiritual Father,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Iſa. 9.6. <hi>and one ſpiritual Seed,</hi> Pſal. 22.30.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. The <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> as it ſignifies the <hi>manner of Adminiſtration,</hi> may be thus deſcribed. It contains the whole, and every part of that Inſtituted Worſhip, whereby God doth ordinarily bring about the purpoſes of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſet Chriſt upon his Throne, and to gather him the Seed given him by the Father, And the Covenant under this acceptation is not one and the ſame alwayes, but hath paſſed under many great alterations and changes.

            <p>The laſt Adminiſtration of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> uſually called the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> is that which was eſtabliſht by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> at his coming.

            <p>The Covenant thus ſtated, with the Scriptures inforcing it, duely weighed, (I queſtion not) would put an end to the Controverſy about the <hi>Birth Priviledge</hi> upon which the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants is founded; and to ballance what Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> and thoſe of his party offer, I ſubmit what's here briefly offered, to the ſerious ſcanning of the <hi>Indifferent</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed</hi> Reader.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe ſeveral texts urged by Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> to confirm his ſecond ſubordinate Propoſition, particularly mentioned, before, I cannot upon the moſt exact examination I am capable to exerciſe, find that they make any thing for him. And but that I queſtion not, but any Reader that has the uſe of his Reaſon, and any Compentency of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Covenant of Grace (or has not a mind to be <hi>bolſtered</hi> up in his <hi>conceit,</hi> and ſo is <hi>loath</hi> to be abuſed) will ſo find it, I would by particular Demonſtration evidence it. Therefore I ſhall only earneſtly recommend to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Reader</hi> this Caution, that he think not the <hi>bare</hi> naming of a <hi>text</hi> or <hi>texts</hi> enough to confirm an opinion, but that he ſeriouſly note the <hi>Context,</hi> with the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Drift</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, and the <hi>coherence</hi> of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> alledged, with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30081:15"/>other <hi>Texts,</hi> before he be inveigled to a cloſure with this, or that converted Tenent. And ſhould I deliver my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it muſt for all that come at laſt to this Deciſion: Therefore I freely appeal to the ſerious Reader; and if he finds Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> hath not <hi>Wreſted</hi> thoſe Texts from their direct and native ſcope and meaning, he is at liberty to joyn with him. For my part I cannot but ſay, that as far as I ſee, they make far more againſt, then for the Doctrine of the <hi>birth priviledge</hi> now in Controverſy.</p>
            <p>The moſt conſiderable <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Scriptures I find Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> inſiſt upon for proof of <hi>Paedobaptiſm,</hi> are <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. and 16.31. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. from which he draws a bold Concluſion; <hi>That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Salvation appertains to the houſes of Believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as ſuch, without reſpect to the perſonal ſaith of any in their houſes beſides their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.10. there is nothing relating to the thing in Controverſy — The Diſciples propound a queſtion about <hi>Divorcement;</hi> and what's that to the point in hand?</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9 Affords no colour for ſuch a concluſion: For Salvation may be ſaid to become to <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe. though none but himſelf be ſaved. He that believes upon a Dictate, that a family may be ſaved by the Maſters faith, will believe any thing. Salvation is tendered to all, but it is applyed only by every ones faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If it be not ſo, they are happy families indeed that can obtain it at ſo eaſie a rate as their Maſters faith! They may lye in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that have a <hi>Zacheus</hi> to believe for them! Surely this is none of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Goſpel, <hi>Rom:</hi> 1.17. and 3.28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3ly. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. Yields as little proof for this aſſertion as the other. And he that can find this Conſequence there, deſerves to be ſtiled <hi>Magnus Apollo.</hi> The promiſe to the Children was not as they were the ſeed of Believers; For their Parents were not <hi>then</hi> Believers, Nor to them, nor any other, but as called, by the Lord, which calling made them Chriſts, and capable of Baptiſm. The whole (as the context ſhews) is an incouragement againſt deſpair by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and wiſhing his blood upon them and their Children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.25. For which very ſin, the Apoſtle tells them they may have Remiſſion, Chriſt being raiſed for their Salvation, and their Childrens (<hi>viz.</hi> their

            <p>Of our mind herein is Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> (a great pleader for Infant Baptiſm) who ſayes in his Reſolutio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> I obſerve all along his Book in defence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſm — borrows his moſt <hi>formidable Artillery</hi> from the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> Yet tells us <hi>be argues not from Analogy with Circumciſion.</hi> But if he can make me believe that, he has a notable faculty of perſwading.

And I appeal to all Readers, whether that <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion</hi> be not the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of his proofs.

            <p>But I ſhall ſhew the evaſion to be frivolous; For whoever pleaſes to peruſe Mr. <hi>Whiſtons</hi> book, will find, that he makes this very ground he renounces the main foundation of his pleading, as preface to the firſt Book. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is an Inſtance of a weak Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed are to be underſtood in a twofold ſenſe. 1. <hi>Natural.</hi> 2. <hi>Spiritual.</hi> And each of theſe again, is to be conſidered as his <hi>next and immediate,</hi> or more <hi>remote</hi> ſeed. The <hi>Jews</hi> were his Natural ſeed, ſome next, ſome remote. And ſuch as were born of his body as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as he did were his ſpiritual ſeed too.

            <p>No Gentile can lay claim to <hi>Abraham</hi> as their Father upon a natural account, he ſtanding in no ſuch Relation to them. But he is a ſpiritual Father to them, if they believe, and nor otherwiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. Nor can a believing Gentile convey that title to his Children which he has not himſelf; The title of Natural Sonſhip, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> no believing Gentile has; Therefore he cannot convey it to his Poſterity; For, <hi>nil dat quod in ſe non habet.</hi> A ſpiritual ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> 'tis true, every <hi>believing</hi> Jew and Gentile is, but ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges (as Goſpel Sonſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are not <hi>hereditary.</hi> A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Child can no more be ſaved by his fathers <hi>faith,</hi> then an unbelievers child can be damned for his fathers ſin. And if the Fathers faith muſt ſerve the childs turn, there's all the reaſon in the world, that the farhers Baptiſm, ſhould alſo be Baptiſm enough to the child Why the one ſhou'd not be imputed as well as the other, is a queſtion worth Mr. <hi>Whiſton's</hi> Reſolution.</p>

            <p>The Conditional Covenant of Grace (if they will ſo call it) I can find it to be no other then this — <hi>Whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall be ſaved</hi> — and 'tis certain this Covenant concerns not Infants, much leſs the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>His Inference of the <hi>perpetuity of the Covenant as it reſpected</hi> Abrahams <hi>Natural ſeed, from the term [Generations]</hi> is vain: For that term holds forth a limited ſeaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> During the legal Adminiſtration — In which ſenſe the term <hi>[Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations]</hi> is frequently uſed as <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.17. and 6.18. and 23.41. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The term as it reſpected <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed, comprehends both the legal and Evangelical Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; but what's that to Infants, who are in that ſenſe his ſeed?</p>
            <p>In concurrence to what we ſay, that Learned man Mr. <hi>William Strong</hi> is very pathetical in his <hi>Select Sermons</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1656. p. 333. on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 21, 22, 23, 24. where he tells us.</p>

                  </gap> ſay how are Infants ſaved then, if under a Covenant of Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer with Dr <hi>Taylor; That as we are ſure God hath not commanded Infants to be baptized, ſo we are ſure he will do them no Injuſtice, nor damn them for what they cannot help therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Baptiſm tranſlates not to a ſtate of Grace, unleſs in Conjunction with Faith — Therefore baptized Infants are never the nearer Salvation meerly for their Baptiſm — And the ſame way they are ſaved when baptized; the very ſame way are the unbaptized Infants ſaved alſo; For the <hi>medium</hi> that proves the one, proves the other alſo.</p>
            <p>Two or three other paſſages Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> produces as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why he reckons Mr. <hi>Hutchinſons</hi> book uſeleſs as to the deſign carryed on in it; But they are of the ſame ſtrain with this; and therefore need no other anſwer.</p>
            <p>P, 248. He charges Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> with ſome <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>abſurdities,</hi> as his calling the <hi>Covenant of Grace and its adminiſtration two diſtinct Covenants, and his ſaying that Circumciſion is a Covenant of works,</hi> from which (ſayes Mr. <hi>Whiſton) It will follow, that a Covenant of Works may be the adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace, which is incongruous.</hi> To which I Reply.</p>
            <p>It is before demonſtrated (I hope undenyably) that the Covenant of Grace is immutable and everlaſting — That in reſpect of its various adminiſtrations under <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> it is called two Covenants, <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old</hi> — That the Covenant of Works (ſo called, under the Law adminiſtred to the Covenant of Grace in Types and Figures, of which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, being the head Ordinance, was <hi>Synechdocally</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <p>MR. <hi>VVills</hi> in the <hi>Prologue</hi> to his <hi>Appeal,</hi> (that the world may ſee he walks by <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi>) produces the <hi>Example</hi> of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> as his <hi>Precedent.</hi> And I confeſs he has in <hi>ſome</hi> things exactly followed his Copy: For as the <hi>Quakers</hi> with great <hi>Outcry</hi> and <hi>Conndence</hi> provok't the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> to examine the Controverſy then in hand, and to paſs their <hi>Sentence;</hi> ſo with like <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>vehemence</hi> Mr. <hi>VVills</hi> falls into the ſame ſtrain of <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous</hi> accuſation againſt Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> And as the <hi>Quakers</hi> (when a <hi>juſt Sentence</hi> was paſt againſt them, evidencing their Clamours to be <hi>Calumnies,</hi> yet) like obſtinate, and incorrigible <hi>accuſers,</hi> fall foul upon the perſons they themſelves had before <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted</hi> their Judges, and with great <hi>wrath</hi> and ſeverity arraign and <hi>condemn</hi> them, for ſpeaking <hi>Truth:</hi> So Mr. <hi>VVills</hi> with Quaker-like inſolence, becauſe the perſons Appealed to, did not <hi>pleaſe</hi> his Spleen in condemning Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> right or wrong; brands them with <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Partiality</hi> in a Paper lately publiſhed, Intituled, <hi>Cenſura Cenſurae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Baptiſts acted with Chriſtian <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>fairneſs</hi> in their Examination of the matter in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and with great <hi>care</hi> end <hi>pains</hi> ſearch't into the <hi>Authors</hi> quoted, I am as ſure of, as I can be of any thing, being an eye-witneſs to, and aſſiſtant in that work. And that their <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Mr. <hi>VVills</hi> was ſo <hi>Modeſt,</hi> that it is beyond the exception of a <hi>ſober</hi> man, the thing it ſelf impartially conſidered will evidence.</p>
                  <p>If it be enquired why the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Mr. VVills</hi> do not <hi>all</hi> concern themſelves in a
<pb facs="tcp:30081:23"/>Vindication? I anſwer. — That they have <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> done what's needfull in giving their Judgement in the things they ought to take cognizance of; And I know no Law, that oblidges them to the <hi>drudgery</hi> of confuting the <hi>Cavills</hi> of ſuch an <hi>inconſiderate</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer. They are perſons ingaged in a <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>neceſſary</hi> work, and to give themſelves any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>interruption</hi> in ſuch a conteſt, is thought to be a <hi>needleſs</hi> task, and an intrenchment upon their more weighty Affairs. Having ſomething elſe to do, then to attend the drudgery of drawing the ſaw with ſuch a lamentable trifler.</p>
                  <p>I am (I confeſs) the weakeſt of them, yet <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> has been pleaſed to caſt this task of their <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> upon me. And <hi>Mr. VVills</hi> himſelf has given me a <hi>particular challenge</hi> and <hi>provocation,</hi> in making ſome exceptions againſt me, (diſtinct from the reſt) which I am oblidged to ſay ſomething to. And I hope, if what I offer be demonſtrative, the <hi>Reader</hi> will expreſs ſo much equity as to judge of the <hi>matter</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute from the <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of it, and not from the <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending. To choſe an <hi>opinion</hi> by voices is not ſafe. <hi>Error,</hi> when it becomes the darling of a man of <hi>parts</hi> (and ſuch are <hi>frequently</hi> its Patrons) is ſet off with all the <hi>imbelliſhments,</hi> which the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> can furniſh him with, which gaudy <hi>paint</hi> makes it often <hi>cheat,</hi> (and paſs for the truth with) <hi>vulgar</hi> eyes, who (gazing on its <hi>ſuperficial</hi> dreſs) ſeldom diſcern <hi>Counterfeit</hi> from <hi>Current.</hi> Hence it happens that ſuch become <hi>Heterodox;</hi> few rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iving the <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>unadorn'd</hi> Truth when rival'd with <hi>aſplended</hi> and <hi>ſpecious error. Sophiſtry</hi> is but <hi>perverted logick;</hi> and that perſon that in his Diſputations borrows his <hi>keeneſt</hi> weapons from it is
<pb facs="tcp:30081:23"/>to be ſuſpected as being ſcarce ſound. I have often found the Advocates of a bad cauſe (as <hi>Ribera</hi> expreſſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>How far Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> has contracted the guilt of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> let his diſcerning Readers deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: For my part I think his greateſt Excellency lyes there, as far as appears to me in his publiſhed Treatiſes. And that he is a meer <hi>Word-pecker,</hi> is very obvious: For if he finds one <hi>miſplac'd, miſinſerted,</hi> or by chance <hi>miſapply'd</hi> (as oft happens with the moſt <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> through the <hi>Tranſcriber</hi> or <hi>Printers</hi> fault) he <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> and <hi>inſults,</hi> as if he had gain'd an <hi>Olympick prize:</hi> Though his own Writings are obnoxious to the ſame <hi>Correction,</hi> as I could abundantly ſhew if needful.</p>
                  <p>It is worth notice, that the main thing in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy (viz. <hi>the Antiquity of Infant Baptiſm</hi>) is quite given up and forſaken by Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> it being evident by Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> &amp;c. That for the firſt <hi>300</hi> years, <hi>The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of grown perſons profeſſing faith, was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally owned and practiced;</hi> and <hi>no Record of credit that aſſures us, that Infant Baptiſm was at all owned as Chriſts ordinance.</hi> The moſt that can be ſaid, is, that it was <hi>Creeping</hi> in, in the third Century, when <hi>Tertullian</hi> oppoſed it, and got ſome ſmall footing by degrees, from the opinion of its <hi>neceſſity to ſalvation</hi> (and that from <hi>a fatal</hi> miſtake of <hi>John 3.5.</hi>) And in the year <hi>416.</hi> received its inſtalment by <hi>humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> being impoſed by a dreadful <hi>Anathema</hi> at the <hi>Milevitan Council.</hi> Certainly had it been the practice of the univerſal Church, <hi>Tertullian</hi> (the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt <hi>Latine</hi> Father) could not have oppos'd it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicted.
<pb facs="tcp:30081:24"/>And it is paſt doubt, that it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik't and cry'd down by many, when that <hi>Council</hi> ſate, elſe their <hi>Canon</hi> was <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>vain.</hi> The <hi>Eclce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Empire</hi> was then upon its <hi>erection,</hi> and <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſm</hi> was thought a neceſſary <hi>pillar</hi> to ſupport it therefore was the oppoſite party from time to time cruſh't with theſe terrifying <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Curſes.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> having loſt his Garriſon, with incorrigible obſtinacy, mans his <hi>Outworks,</hi> and <hi>Approaches,</hi> pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Contempt and <hi>Appeals,</hi> as if he would carry all by <hi>noiſe;</hi> but how ſuch a <hi>re-attack</hi> ſhall prevail, is eaſy to be conjectured.</p>
                  <p>Had Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> accepted of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> modeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to <hi>give him ſatisfaction in a private way, with promiſed aſſurance, that he would publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant any mistakes, which the cloſeſt ſcrutinie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different perſons, mutually choſen could bring to light;</hi> it had been a ſtrong argument that he had ſought to <hi>clear</hi> and defend <hi>Truth,</hi> not purchaſe <hi>Applauſe,</hi> &amp;c. And had ſaved a great deal of <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in Print he muſt be; yet has not the ingenuity and common honeſty to retract, or repent for his own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious miſtakes and falſehoods (ſo fully detected and enumerated by Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> in his Writings, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his <hi>Rejoynd.</hi> from p. <hi>49.</hi> to <hi>77.</hi> whilſt he has the confidence (not to ſay impudence) with ſo much ſeverity, to take by the throat, and exact from him the utmoſt mite, yea and that for miſtakes of his own making too which he ſo unjuſtly Fathers upon him.</p>
                  <p>Diſcovering hereby his folly and ſhamful partiality, that whilſt as concerning his own errors, he can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look Beams, ſwallow Camels, and leap over Mountains, He can with ſuch an Eagle eye diſcover the Motes, ſtrain at the Gnats, &amp; magnify the Male-hills of others.</p>

                  <head>A juſt Reproof to Mr. <hi>Obed Will's,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>IN p. 14: of our Anſwer to <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> Appeal, after we had as <hi>mildly</hi> treated him, and with as much <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality</hi> as was poſſible; we made a motion to him, that <hi>if he thought himſelf concern'd to appear any further in the Controverſy, he would be perſwaded that things may be tranſacted in an amicable and friendly way, which we hop'd may tend to our mutual ſatisfaction, in the clearing up of truth, and to cheriſh that love, that all that fear the Lord ſhould bear each other, though differing in ſome things.</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he comes forth in ſuch a <hi>Contemptuous, Sarcaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and <hi>Inſulting</hi> ſpirit, as if that mode of writing were the very <hi>Sinews</hi> of his undertaking, and of the eſſence of his faculty. Which I ſhall mention only once for all, and betake my ſelf more immediatly to the matter of his <hi>Cenſure,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither <hi>leaſure,</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> to ſtrive with him for maſtery in ſuch <hi>Rhetorick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. He ſayes p. 5. <hi>That we accuſe him for what was never brought to our Bar.</hi> But if he muſt needs call us forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſeeking of ours, and inveſt us with a power to <hi>Judge</hi> his <hi>Appeal,</hi> he muſt give us leave alſo, (which is not deny'd to any in that <hi>Capacity,</hi> as appealed unto) to hint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him what <hi>Circumſtances</hi> we found, that made his grievance not ſo <hi>notirious</hi> as he pretended, and the antecedent paſſages that argued him <hi>precipitant,</hi> and the <hi>Defendent far</hi> from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. He ſayes <hi>we borrow our accuſations from Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>Preface.</hi> But ſuppoſe we had, that's no excuſe ſufficient for him: For he ſhould have diſprov'd the things if untrue. We noted them from our own knowledge of the <hi>truth</hi> of them, and not meerly becauſe <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> ſaid ſo.</p>
                  <p>His talk <hi>that we gave Mr.</hi> Danvers's <hi>Judgment, not our own; and that the things brought to our Bar, we carry'd back to his;</hi> is utterly untrue: For we conſulted with him no more then the nature of the matter before us required; Nor did we hold any Intelligence with him, but what conſiſted with <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Impartiality.</hi> We were obliged in equity to hear him, before we could proceed to a determination: For <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram andire partem,</hi> is allowed in every Law. And that our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30081:25"/>
                     <hi>anſwer</hi> was <hi>à capite ad Calcem</hi> of <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> forming, as <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> has the confidence to publiſh, p. 8 is a groſs falſhood, and his Inference of our <hi>Colluſion,</hi> unrighteous; His very parallels confute him; VVe muſt needs have the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as far as we treat upon the ſame thing; yet our expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are not of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> framing.</p>
                  <p>VVhether <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> hath done ſuch great ſervice, as he boaſts of p. 6. <hi>in detecting Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>his miſtakes,</hi> any further then what are acknowledg'd, is left to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Readers</hi> to determine. VVhat we found fault with, in <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> his <hi>appeal,</hi> deſerves a ſmarter reprehenſion then we gave him. <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> truly, and ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates it; and <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> anſwers it not but with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of little weight. For if <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> upon a <hi>private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation,</hi> had retracted publickly, what he miſrepreſented, why may it not be as ſatisfactory, as if after this publick, and clamerous way of detection? VVe know no reaſon to the contrary; but that then perhaps <hi>Mr Wills</hi> might miſs of the glory of the Conqueſt he fancies he has obtained, and the opportunity of making this <hi>Oſtertation</hi> of his parts.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>own method</hi> he is left to follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; But that <hi>method</hi> of an <hi>Appeal,</hi> that accepts of no <hi>treatment</hi> with the perſon charged, and yet cryes out for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is moſt <hi>irregular,</hi> if ſquared with the rule of God in caſes of offence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. And if <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> find nor the <hi>Apellatees contumacie,</hi> to be a neceſſary circumſtance in the Lawyers <hi>Definition</hi> of an <hi>Appeal,</hi> yet he may find it in <hi>Chriſts</hi> directions in caſes of <hi>Appeal,</hi> in the <hi>text</hi> cited; Yea ſo neceſſary, that <hi>no appeal muſt be made, but upon the Criminals refuſal to hear, Mat.</hi> 18.16. &amp;c. And ſurely that <hi>Patern</hi> ought to challenge more of our Conformity, then the Lawyers <hi>Maximes,</hi> which are not to teach us <hi>Divinity.</hi> Hence we made a <hi>Difference</hi> of the <hi>binds</hi> of <hi>Appeals,</hi> which <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> might have underſtood, if he had been candid, when we ſaid <hi>An appeal in theſe caſes,</hi> viz. Religions Conteſts, which is not his Lawyers buſineſs to Define. Now whether that <hi>Law</hi> above mentioned be not <hi>againſt the form</hi> of <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> his <hi>Appeal,</hi> is left to his more ſerious conſideration.</p>
                  <p>But he tells us p. 7. <hi>That if we had conſidered things as we ought, we might have ſeen good cauſt for his way of procedure. And gives</hi> 4 <hi>Inſtances to prove Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>Contumacious; Three from the</hi> Magdeburgs, <hi>and a quotation from</hi> Luther.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30081:25"/>
                  <p>To which it is replyed, that the three inſtances from the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> afford no <hi>Juſtification</hi> of <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure. For any judicious Reader will find upon peruſal of the 1ſt. of thoſe places he cites, that <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> is guilty of no greater miſtake, then <hi>not obſerving an exact variation of the character;</hi> which <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> knows is too often the <hi>Printers</hi> fault, (and his own Books are not free from it) For which <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> makes amends enough, in owning pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly the words to be his own.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. As to that of adding the word <hi>[only] Mr. Danvers</hi> gives a very ſatisfactory Return to it, in his <hi>Reply</hi> p. 32. (and Rejoyned p. 54, 55.) His words being a neceſſary <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> from the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> ſpeech, who expreſly ſay — <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizatos eſſe adultos exempla probant,</hi> and, <hi>de Infantibus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizatis exempla annotata non leguntur,</hi> which put together amounts to what he ſayes, viz. <hi>That the</hi> Magdeburghs <hi>find only examples for adult baptiſm viz.</hi> In the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they produce. Therefore it is ſtrange that Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> ſhould inſiſt with ſo much <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> upon this particular.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. As to the third, that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> quoted thoſe pages 125, 126. as <hi>relating to the ſuperſtitious rites,</hi> may (without any ſuch impoſſibility as Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> talks of) be underſtood by a mean Reader. And ſurely none but a man of <hi>Cavil</hi> would inſinuate it, as ſuch a Juſtification, for ſo irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and clamerous an <hi>Appeal</hi> as his is, if you read Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Treat. p. 101. Reply p. 36. and Rejoynder p. 71.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. As to the Quotation from <hi>Luther,</hi> as we compared it with the <hi>plain and well grounded Treatiſe</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> mentions p. 40. <hi>Rejoynd.</hi> whence he took it, and which we found to be word for word, as he expreſſed, and where it ſeems it was miſquoted, ſo, we are ſatisfied he is therein <hi>no forger.</hi> And though he mentioned it not in his <hi>Reply,</hi> yet one miſtake not owned, will ſcarce be enough to vindicate Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> his procedure; (and his refuſing the <hi>civil accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> tendred him) to rectifie all miſtakes as in his Preface to Rejoynder moſt amply appears: And let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that if one miſtake, not own'd by a ſufficient ground to render a perſon contumacious and ſtubborn, and will juſtifie an Appeal againſt him. Then what will thoſe many do which <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> in his Rejoynd. p. 21. to 77. charges upon <hi>Mr. Will's?</hi> In that appeal to his conſcience for his Impenitency, for Backbiting, Scoffing, Railing ſalfe Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30081:26"/>Slandering, Prevarication, Forgery, Miſtranſlation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As demonſtrated by divers inſtances out of his Writings.</p>
                  <p>Yet let it withall be underſtood as to that one particular, had Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> had but had ſo much patience to have heard <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> Anſwer thereto, as is ſo fully expreſt in his Rejoynder before he had Appealed, he had doubtleſs ſaved himſelf and others the trouble thereof.</p>
                  <p>So that upon a candid ſurvey of theſe <hi>four</hi> paſſages, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be found in them to juſtifie Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> his raſh and inconſiderate procedure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That we conſulted with the party accuſed for a ſentence</hi> (which he bids us <hi>deny if we can,</hi> p. 10.) is <hi>not</hi> demonſtrated by his Inſtances, compared with this <hi>Reply.</hi> And is hereby denyed, and hope a bare Negation will be deem'd as valid, as the unprov'd aſſertion of a man, that ſhews himſelf ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>halting</hi> in this kind, as (to an indifferent <hi>Reader</hi>) may eaſily appear.</p>
                  <p>He tells us p. 10. <hi>That there is much in our dealing with his Appeal that looks like partiality, of which he pretends to give a fourfold Inſtance. In remarking ſome things in his Appeal as falſe and Injurious, or unfit, and paſſing by in ſilence ſome things in</hi> Mr. Danvers <hi>of the ſame or like nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> If Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> had conſidered things with candor and ſobriety, he might have known, that it was our work to give <hi>Judgment</hi> only in <hi>matter of fact</hi> diſputed by them both, and ſuch as were Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> his miſtakes, and never owned ſo, was our part to <hi>remark</hi> to him in <hi>order</hi> to his <hi>acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> VVhereas there was not the like reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> his miſtakes, they being already owned in Print. For which we made a ſufficient <hi>Apology</hi> in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer p. 13. No more being required from us, but to bring <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> to ſuch a <hi>publick acknowledgment.</hi> And <hi>Mr. Wills</hi> his bare ſaying, that <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> his anſwers to ſome of them, are not only weak, but untrue, is no proof, that they are ſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. <hi>In giving our Judgments only upon part of his Appeal, and paſſing by others, as the ſtrange Doctrines he charges upon him, which Mr.</hi> VVill's <hi>ſayes we ſlightly anſwer.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> For this alſo we give the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> p. 14. <hi>Becauſe they were things Controverted</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> betwixt us and Paedobaptiſts, who ſomtimes beſtow that Epithete upon ſome Doctrines which we own not to be ſo) And it were as proper for <hi>Mr.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30081:26"/>Will's</hi> to put the Queſtion, <hi>whether Infants Baptiſm be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our</hi> Deciſion as theſe things. And to put it out of doubt, <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> his anſwer to them is owned to be <hi>good</hi> and ſubſtantial <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> p. 49, 50, 51. And our ſaying they were <hi>Collateral, is no untruth;</hi> the grand Queſtion before us, being, <hi>Whether</hi> Mr. Danvers <hi>was ſuch a falſiſter as his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer pretended;</hi> and not whether Infant Baptiſm was lawful: For to put that Cueſtion to us, would be <hi>Ridioulous.</hi> And whether what we mention about the <hi>Milevitan Canon,</hi> be ſo <hi>Collateral,</hi> as <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> pretends, ſhall be conſidered in its due place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. <hi>In taking</hi> Mr Danvers <hi>words for Anſwers to ſome of the particulars in his Appeal, and for ſufficient anſwers to the trivial and inſignificant.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> — If <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> his anſwers were <hi>full</hi> and <hi>proper,</hi> here lyes no <hi>juſt</hi> charge againſt us, nor any inſtance of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</hi> And when <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> demonſtrates they were not ſo, it ſhall be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. As to what relates to my ſelf, I refer you to my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular defence made afterwards by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Next Mr. <hi>Will's, having,</hi> as he ſayes (though untruly) <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted our Partiality,</hi> comes to ſhew <hi>that</hi> Mr. Danvers <hi>his acknowledgments are not ſo ingenuous as we make them;</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. About the paſſage of <hi>Nazianzen Baptizandos peccata ſua confiteri ſolitos,</hi> which <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> owns ſhould be Tranſlated, <hi>The Baptized were wont to confeſs their ſins.</hi> And what would Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> have more? Would he have Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> ſay he prevaricated, when his Conſcience tells him no ſuch matter? Or can Mr. <hi>Wih's</hi> make out, that that ſenſe Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> deduced is not to be <hi>Conſequently</hi> drawn from that expreſſion?</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his acknowledging his error about <hi>Deus Dedit,</hi> prevented that fear of Mr. <hi>Will's,</hi> that <hi>the Reader might conclude that gifts were given by the Baptized to the Church, and his gueſſing happily thereby that none were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but the adult.</hi> And is not that enough?</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. As to the quotation out of <hi>Walden</hi> about <hi>Wickliff,</hi> the thing charged upon Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> was, <hi>That he made</hi> Walden <hi>ſay, that</hi> Wickliffs <hi>Doctrine was very agreeable to the Doctrine of former Hereticks, as</hi> Pelagius, <hi>&amp;c. App.</hi> p. 173. Which he owned to be his <hi>miſtake.</hi> And what could we expect more from him? It was not our buſineſs to lanch into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30081:27"/>whether <hi>Wickliff</hi> oppoſed Infant Baptiſm <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That muſt be <hi>ſub judice.</hi> Though by the way, ſince Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that <hi>Wickliff</hi> and the <hi>Albegois</hi> did deny that Infants were to be Baptized with Water, as neceſſary to their Salvation; has himſelf confirmed the truth of the thing, till he make appear that the <hi>Paedohaptiſts</hi> in thoſe dayes did upon any other ground Baptize their Infants. VVhich Mr. <hi>Timbes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> have ſo often called for. That of the Faederal right, which the Proteſtant Paedobaptiſts have ſo boaſted of, being but of yeſterday; never heard of as ſaid, till <hi>Zwinglius</hi> time. And as to <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> his talk, <hi>that we never examined the Hiſtory of theſe things,</hi> it is untrue, and juſt of the complexion of the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. That miſtake about <hi>Zonaras,</hi> p. 41. is alſo own'd; and if Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> in his own conceit magnifies it as <hi>no ſuch trifle;</hi> he muſt give us, and others, the <hi>liberty</hi> of our thoughts</p>
                  <p n="5">5ly. The miſtake about <hi>Lanifrank,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> very honeſtly owned, and intended to rectifie it before <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> minded him of it; which is enough to ſatisfie any man of common ingenuity. And thoſe other <hi>untruths Mr. Will's</hi> found complicated there (as he ſayes) were acknowledg'd in the <hi>grand</hi> error that produced them, and could no more injure any afterwards, then branches can grow, when the root is taken away.</p>
                  <p n="6">6ly. The miſtake of <hi>Sericius</hi> for <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>omarus</hi> is alſo owned, which was to us enough; though the following words of <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> ſhould be omitted.</p>
                  <p>Next <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> comes to ſhew, <hi>That the particulars in his Appeal, which we call trivial and inſignificant, deſerve not thoſe epithetes:</hi> And that <hi>Mr. Danvers his anſwers, which we make our own, are very inſufficient to ſatifie an Impartial Reader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> In regard <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> makes the greateſt <hi>Flouriſh,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>angling about the particulars he brings under this head; I ſhall offer theſe few conſiderations to all impartial men, in juſtification of our procedure herein.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt That the thing charged upon <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> was <hi>forgery</hi> and <hi>perverting</hi> of <hi>Authors,</hi> which indeed is a great charge, and reflects much infamy upon the Cauſe that muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to ſuch props for its ſupport.— And that Mr <hi>Wills</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n theſe particulars made that charge good, doth not yet appear.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:30081:27"/>2ly: It is acknowledged <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> was in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars miſtaken, which we found him very willing to own, as publickly as he had before delivered them; and which, as far as he was convinced of, are acknowledg'd in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder,</hi> but how inconſiderable the Reader can beſt judge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. It muſt be declared (that as far as we are capable to judge, both from the <hi>experience</hi> of his <hi>Integrity, Candor,</hi> and <hi>piety,</hi> as vvell as our <hi>tracing</hi> him upon this occaſion, in his quotations) we could not find any of his miſtakes to proceed from that principle Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> inſinuates, <hi>Infant Bapt.</hi> p. 57. viz. <hi>That he will not refuſe the moſt ſordid, and ſhameful wayes to promote his cauſe; or that he knowingly miſrepreſented any of his Authors.</hi> And we cannot but judge Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> an <hi>egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over-laſher,</hi> in that conſident aſſertion, p. 34. of the <hi>ſame book</hi> viz. <hi>That never any writer did more prevaricate, or ſhew more falſhood then he hath done; and that he would certainly have forborn it, if he had thought any man would have been at the trouble to examine and ſearch, whether he ſpoke truth or not.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. Inaſmuch as we found no ſuch <hi>weight</hi> in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars under this head, as Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> would ſuggeſt, to prove his charge of <hi>prevarication,</hi> but on the contrary, an enumeration of <hi>Cavilling</hi> exceptions of no great affinity to the <hi>general</hi> charge of <hi>Forgery,</hi> &amp;c. And in our Judgments for the moſt part ſufficiently defended by Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> we thought no law, did oblidge us to condemn him for a <hi>Forger,</hi> from ſuch inſtances as carryed no ſufficient evidence in them, that he was ſo. And therefore theſe particulars coming ſo far ſhort, of what <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> produced them for; what fitter <hi>Epithetes</hi> could we give them, then that they were <hi>trivial</hi> and <hi>inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſicant,</hi> and merited not a ſecond Confutation?</p>
                  <p>But ſince Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> now falls upon us, the ſaid particulars ſhall be reviewed, and the naked ſenſe given of them, and ſo diſcharge any further tranſaction, in ſuch conteſts, with ſo unreaſonable an oppoſite. And if Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> will have the laſt word, I think I ſhall not quarrel with him for it.</p>
                  <p>And as for his <hi>menace</hi> of an anſwer to <hi>Mr. Danvers Rejoynder,</hi> it is like his way of dealing, and ſcarce to be reconciled to the Concluſion of his firſt preface <hi>vind.</hi> VVhere he <hi>gives ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for his future ſilence.</hi> But if the Circumſtances he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth his Antagoniſt is under, may incourage Mr. <hi>Will's,</hi> to revive his <hi>clamours,</hi> and perpetuate, the quarrel, we hope
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30081:28"/>If his attempts be worth oppoſition) truth ſhall not want an <hi>Advocate,</hi> that may diſappoint this <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vader</hi> of the <hi>Trophyes</hi> he promiſes himſelf in its ſpoil. But to the matter,</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> having quoted a paſſage from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to ſhew that Apoſtolical tradition was eſteem'd the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ground of Infant Baptiſm, (it ſeems) omitted that ſaying— <hi>deducitur evidenter ex Scripturis.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Fields</hi> ſaying, (after ſuch another expreſſion) <hi>that the Scriptures deliver us the ground of it Mr. Will's</hi> though he pleads for himſelf in the like caſe, <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 7. accuſes him for it <hi>App.</hi> p. 162. To which 'tis ſaid, that in all ſuch caſes, to <hi>prevent</hi> Cavil and offence, it were better; if the <hi>intire</hi> ſentence were alwayes <hi>expreſt.</hi> But the Circumſtances that made this appear to us, to have, no great weight in it, were theſe, 1ſt. <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> ſets down <hi>Rep.</hi> p. 74. theſe words of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> omitted before, of which we were bound to take <hi>notice,</hi> being a Book <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> his <hi>appeal,</hi> and before any reproof for the omiſſion. as we can find.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. It is evident the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> urged <hi>Tradition</hi> for their practice of <hi>Paedobaptiſm;</hi> And that phraſe was but a <hi>faint</hi> Inſinuation, <hi>that it may be gathered from Scripture,</hi> viz. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. and ſuch <hi>miſtaken</hi> places. And the quotation was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently enough applyed, if Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> his example were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient excuſe for thoſe that imitate him, <hi>in giving only what Authors ſay to the matter in hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his <hi>Anſwer</hi> in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> p 25. here are two <hi>new</hi> errors charged 1. <hi>That he ſayes he quoted</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine <hi>under the head of Tradition.</hi> 2. <hi>That he quotes the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages before omitted, under the head of Conſequences</hi> p. 74. <hi>Reply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. 'Tis true, the term <hi>[Tradition]</hi> is not mentioned in the Contents of that Chapter, but there is that that's equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, viz. <hi>The Scriptures total ſilence about Infant Baptiſm; with the neceſſity of Scripture warrant to Authorize every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</hi> For both which <hi>branches</hi> ſeveral Authors are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for the firſt, which he expreſly owns, <hi>viz. That there is no expreſs Scripture for it,</hi> though he pretends it may be <hi>deduced</hi> from thence.</p>
                  <p>That Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> quotes that paſſage <hi>Rep.</hi> p. 74. (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> owns, being not able to contradict it. And though the <hi>Chapter</hi> or <hi>Section,</hi> has not the term <hi>[conſequence]</hi> mentioned, no more then the other <hi>[Tradition,]</hi> Yet the <hi>Marginal</hi> note expreſſes it to be a <hi>Tradition</hi> (as they word
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30081:28"/>it) <hi>gathered from the Scriptures</hi> — which is the <hi>ſame</hi> with them as <hi>Conſequence.</hi> So that upon the whole matter, it doth nor appear how this charge can be advanced to any other title then <hi>trivial</hi> and <hi>inſignificant,</hi> nor can we expect that labour can turn to any great account, that's ſpent in conſulting ſuch a meer <hi>Catching</hi> at words.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. 'Tis true, we find not Dr. <hi>Field expreſly</hi> quoted in that 74th. page; Yet it is to be conſidered that it is plainly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd</hi> to. For Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> drawing a <hi>Parallel</hi> between the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Paedobaptiſts,</hi> ſayes thus p. 74. <hi>Do the Papiſts affirm that notwithſtanding it is a Tradition or cuſtome of the Church, yet that it is plainly enough gathered out of the Scriptures,</hi> viz. <hi>from Circumciſion;</hi> for which he quotes <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi> And then adds — ſo <hi>doth Mr.</hi> Will's <hi>for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſay</hi> (who in p. 105, 106, 107, 108. <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> gives their <hi>ſentiments</hi> from <hi>Rivet, Calvin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> the later in this <hi>very quotation</hi> word for word, all which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſums up) <hi>that notwithſtanding there is neither precept nor practice expreſly written in the Scripture, yet it is gathered thence by conſequence, as coming in the room of Circumciſion; and therefore that Infants have a right to Baptiſm, from the right that Infants had to Circumciſion</hi> Mr. Will's p. 105. Now Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> referring to the place where Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> quotes the Proteſtants, one of which was Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> referred ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily alſo to Dr. <hi>Field</hi> there, which the matter diſputed, muſt needs lead the enquiring <hi>Reader</hi> to; And though it were better in order to prevent the Cavils of ſuch as lye at Catch to be more <hi>expreſs</hi> in references, yet we conceive a <hi>Candid</hi> and Judicious Reader will have better thoughts of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> in this particular, then what are ſuggeſted by an <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> that ſo ground leſly perſerveres in his <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> inculcations of <hi>unfaithfulneſs</hi> in Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> in us; and that without ſtronger demonſtration then ſuch frivolous Inſtances as this, and what are <hi>ejuſdem farinae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. As to the paſſage of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is full and proper, and ſatisfactory (doubtleſs) to any ingenious Reader, as appears in his <hi>Reyonder</hi> p. 25, 26. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed needleſs to add any more thereto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> Appeals to the Reader p. 22, 23: <hi>Whether the paſſages about</hi> Lydia, Beza <hi>and</hi> Ames <hi>App. p.</hi> 167. be ſo <hi>trivial</hi> and <hi>inſignificant</hi> as we make them. And which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo left to be determined at that <hi>Tribunal,</hi> whether they be not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30081:29"/>indeed ſo? Or have evidenced enough in them, to prove <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> a forger?</p>
                  <p>Next he Renews his Charge of <hi>Self-contradiction</hi> againſt <hi>Mr. Danvers,</hi> viz. <hi>That if he made the ground of the</hi> Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians <hi>ſcruple</hi> 1 Cor. 7.4. <hi>To ariſe from the inſtance of putting away ſtrange Wives in</hi> Ezra <hi>and</hi> Nehemiah's <hi>time, it was a plain contradiction to make the words</hi> [<hi>elſe were,</hi> &amp;c] <hi>an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> ab abſurdo, <hi>becauſe from thoſe Inſtances they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no otherwiſe, but that their children were Baſtards, and to be put away;</hi> And then <hi>deſires ſuch of us, as know what an Argument</hi> abaſſurdo <hi>is, to exerciſe our reaſon about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and again affirm it no contradiction, if we can, and the Inſtance trivial and inſignificant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> What <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> calls a <hi>contradiction</hi> here, appears not ſo to be, but the contrary. For the <hi>Jews</hi> being under a ſtrict inhibition to marry with ſtrange wives, or mix with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as appears <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and began a Reformation in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time. Which practice of old, queſtionleſs gave ground to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcruple, whether the believing husband or wife may coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit with the unbelieving Yokefellow. Which doubt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> Reſolves in the affirmative; as if he had told them, 'tis true, you were ſtrictly prohibited under the law to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit with ſtrange wives; but that was under a Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is now relaxt: And the end of ſuch a prohibition [viz. <hi>to keep the people of whom according to the fleſh, the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>was to come, unmixt with the Idolatrous Nations</hi>] is now come to paſs, as ſo the cohabiting with a ſtrange or unbelieving Yokefellow, which was then a ſin, is not ſo now; and the iſſue of ſuch a marriage, is not <hi>illigitimate</hi> now, as it was then; Therefore the relation is mutually <hi>ſanctified, elſe</hi> (that is, had not the Goſpel diſpenſation taken off the legal inhibition aforeſaid, and the Relation were not ſo ſanctified <hi>your children were unclean,</hi> (that is, the iſſue of an unlawful bed;) <hi>but now,</hi> [the Goſpel diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on allowing this Cohabitation] <hi>are they holy;</hi> that is, not the product of an unlawful marriage, as in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> time, but legitimate. And therefore the Apoſtle uſes an Argument <hi>ab abſurdo</hi> (which is drawn from the abſurdity following the contrary practice) to perſwade them to dwell together, that ſo they might not fall into the abſurdity, they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30081:29"/>were by their ſeparation thinking to avoid; the way to have an unhallowed iſſue, being now <hi>contrary</hi> to what it was in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, <hi>viz.</hi> theirs was ſo by <hi>cohabiting,</hi> but ours by <hi>ſeparation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore where to find any other contradiction here, then what is between the two diſpenſations of Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, vve cannot yet diſcover. VVas it Contradiction in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to ſatisfie the ſeruple of his doubting <hi>Gorinthians,</hi> and to ſhevv them, that the vvay they vvould take to eſcape an abſurdity, vvas to fall into it? Certainly this charge is eaſily avoided, and the Contradiction found there, if any, degenerates from its definition given by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> l. 1. poſter. c. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So that I conclude there is no inconvenience in affirming this inſtance to be ſtill <hi>trivial</hi> and <hi>inſignificant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Will's</hi> his next inſtance of ſelf contradiction is as p. 24. <hi>That Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>tells us</hi> [from <hi>Sabaſtin Franck</hi>] 2 Ed. p. 231. <hi>That about the year</hi> 610. <hi>Childrens Baptiſm was held in many places of little eſteem</hi> [by the learned endeavours of <hi>Adrianus</hi> and others] <hi>And yet in his Reply</hi> p. 140. <hi>He tells us</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Auſtin</hi>] <hi>That Infants Baptiſm was univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the</hi> 7 <hi>Age</hi> [in other parts of the VVorld] <hi>to beget them to regeneration</hi> [as impoſed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> —</p>

And Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> citing it from thence acquits him from the Charge of <hi>forging</hi> or <hi>perverting</hi> it.

                  <p>At length Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> p. 31. comes to vind cate the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances we remark to him.

And if Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> eſteems that <hi>firſt, a worſe editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we are not of his mind in that particular: For we judge that paſſage as it is <hi>altered</hi> to contain an <hi>untruth,</hi> as may be eaſily demonſtrated; and the <hi>Drs.</hi> firſt to be ſound and conſonant to the moſt Orthodox Writers, and to himſelf alſo in the ſame thing.

                  <p n="8">8ly.

                  <p>He obſerves, <hi>as he tells us</hi> p. 10.

This is what he ſayes to me in particular. And to which I Reply,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I can in ſincerety ſay, that what I writ by way of</hi> enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium, <hi>as Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>calls it, upon Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>his Works, or againſt his Antagoniſts (both Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>and Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>being, when I writ that</hi> Epiſtle, <hi>equally</hi> Strangers <hi>to me) was the reſult of that perſwaſion which the clear and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> evidence of truth <hi>begets in an</hi> impartial ſearcher. <hi>And I ſhall not be aſhamed to own that my judgment is ſtill the ſame, for all the pains which Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>hath taken, which ſeems to me, to manifeſt him rather an</hi> impertinent captious wrangler, (<hi>whoſe maſter-piece is</hi> Sophiſm <hi>and</hi> Logomachy) <hi>then an Author of ſuch Reaſon and Sobriety, that all his Readers muſt be charmed into a ſubſcription to his ill-prov'd affirmations. And I am very certain, that men: as clear ſighted as himſelf, and at leaſt, as well advantag'd in</hi> Learning <hi>and</hi> Piety, <hi>are fully of my opinion; that though Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>(through the</hi> toil <hi>of ſo many quotations, and being not</hi> Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible) <hi>had miſtook ſome inconſiderable things; yet the grand mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in diſpute is managed with ſuch</hi> Scripturer evidence, <hi>and illuſtrated with ſuch</hi> humane concurrence, <hi>as is beyond the power of Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>his Negatives to invalidate, at leaſt with the ſober and impartial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is to we an inſtance that this Advocate of</hi> Paedo-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <hi>manages a</hi> languiſhing <hi>Cauſe, becauſe be is driven to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt upon ſuch a parcel of exceptions, as truly and really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Epithetes of</hi> trivial <hi>and</hi> inſignificant, <hi>and of ſo little moment to the point in hand, that had Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>wholly left them out, his Cauſe had been fortified well enough without them; not only by the</hi> intire Book of God, <hi>but many of the moſt</hi> undoubted humane Teſtimonies, <hi>not at all, or very</hi> faintly <hi>aſſaulted.

                     <hi>But</hi> I am byaſſed, <hi>he ſayes,</hi> becauſe I expreſs my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him, <hi>&amp;c. I muſt confeſs that I have no ſuch eſteem of his works, as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>beſpeaks for him in his Epiſtle; nor do I look upon him to be ſo infallible as to greet him for an</hi> Oracle; <hi>nor does his</hi> Paedo baptiſm <hi>appear to me to be ſo ſcriptural a practice, and ſo ancient as he would make it. And I believe all the</hi> Baptiſts <hi>in</hi> England <hi>are ſo far byaſſed. And therefore his</hi> Appeal <hi>was but at beſt ridiculous, if he inſiſts upon that</hi> Objection, <hi>that none of them ſhould be admitted to examine his</hi> Appeal <hi>whoſe</hi> Judgements <hi>beſpeaks them</hi> Parties. <hi>And he might level that exception againſt any of them as well as againſt me, ſince they are all parties ſo far as to diſapprove Infant Baptiſm.</hi> &amp; <hi>Which makes me conceive that Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf, (ſince no Baptiſt muſt without becoming obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this objection, paſs a ſentence upon his Appeal) that it might paſs</hi> without Anſwer <hi>But,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For any contempt or prejudice to his perſon, (which as I ſaid I am a</hi> meer ſtranger <hi>to) as far as I know my own heart, I can ſay, I have none, And though I am fully ſatisfied his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is very much againſt truth; yet have I as far as I have been concern'd,</hi> examined <hi>things, as to matter of</hi> fact <hi>(which only come under our</hi> Cognizance <hi>as appealed unto) without any</hi> reſpect <hi>to</hi> perſon <hi>or</hi> cauſe. <hi>And I know that the perſons concern'd in the examination beſides my ſelf, have cted their parts with</hi> naked impurtiality <hi>and candor, and truly ſtated things as they appeared unto them.

                     <hi>But that this very word printed for it (as it happens) yields Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>no ſuch inſtance of my</hi> ignorance, <hi>will be very evident to him that conſiders what</hi> Epentheſis, Syncope, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiteſes, <hi>&amp;c. are.

                        <p>Hence it is, that whereas the point of <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> (which you tell us <hi>has its conſiderable difficulties</hi>) came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a freſh <hi>diſquiſition,</hi> ſeveral <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> perſons hoped that a ſerious and full debate thereof, would fix the minds of men, and eſtabliſh that truth ſo long contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.

But upon the appearance of that <hi>bulky piece</hi> of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocation, artifice and diſtinction, we found our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation fruſtrated, and that you had ſhamefutlly baffled your admirers, who may juſtly exclaime in the language of the Prophet; <hi>Surely every man in his beſt eſtate is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity</hi> — And pray to be delivered from the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> pronounced <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> Therefore Sir you muſt give us leave to tell you that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

And therefore there is as much <hi>holyneſs</hi> from this text to be aſcribed to the <hi>unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> husband or wiſe, as to the Children. And why the unbelieving husband or wiſe may not be therefore baptiſed and in Church too, as well as their Infants, this holyneſs being pleaded by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to be ſederal, (though it be as clear as the Sun that the perſons Denominated <hi>holy were</hi> at that very time <hi>privative unbelievers</hi> and ſo cannot be ſaid to be ſoederally holy or ſanctyfied) is a queſtion worth the Reſolution of ſuch an <hi>Oedipus</hi> as himſelf. But in my opinion, he can never make any clean evaſion from this abſurdity. And if he can ſatisfie his Conſcience that this text is ſo plain to prove the <hi>federal holyneſs</hi> of the Children of believers, it is to me an Inſtance, that his Judgement is <hi>enſlaved</hi> by a <hi>peremptory</hi> and tenacious <hi>will.</hi> Now I apdeal

And as the word <gap reason="foreign">

And of ſuch a holy child what great cauſe will there be to boaſt as a fit ſubject for Baptiſm? And whether ſuch <hi>a holyneſs</hi> be not ſo far from foederal, that it is purely <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> and oppoſed to that <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by Cohabiting with <hi>ſtrange wives</hi> prohibited under the Law, is ſubmitted to the determination of the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

                  <p>Next Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us, <hi>that man muſt not teach God how to ſpeak, but carefully enquire, what he hath ſpoken</hi> — To which I willingly aſſent. And if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had been ſo ſecurely modeſt and ſober, as to content himſelf with what was ſpoken to him by the Lord, and had not given his <hi>licentious Imagination</hi> ſo unbounded a ſcope, as to peſter the Nation with his <hi>confounding, unſcriptural legions of diſtinctions,</hi> and <hi>frivolous niceties</hi> with which his <hi>Polemicks</hi> are ſo ſtufft, he had done more ſervice, then the utmoſt exploits of his <hi>talking faculty</hi> will ever amount to.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30081:44"/>well as the children; and therefore 'tis his part to make it out ſuch <hi>a great and comfortable priviledge as he talks of.</hi> And the term <hi>Heathen</hi> is all one with <hi>Gentiles,</hi> contradiſtinct to <hi>Jews,</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> goes on p. 9. and tells us, <hi>that being called to a Review, he remembers our Saviour himſelf was a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in his Infancy, even the head</hi> (though he ſaid in his <hi>Plain Scriptare</hi> p. 62. <hi>that 'tis diſputable, whether ever Chriſt was a Church-member properly, or no) And if an Infant was capable of being the head, King, Prieſt, and Prophet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, though yet he had never ruled, ſacrificed, or taught, then there is nothing in the Infant age which maketh it unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, of being members, ſubjects, and Diſciples of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This vain plea is already ſufficiently anſwered by Mr. <hi>Tombs.</hi> And to me what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> urges, ſeems to make more againſt, then for his Paedo baptiſm — For if Chriſt whoſe <hi>title</hi> to the <hi>headſhip</hi> of <hi>Churchmembers</hi> in his <hi>Inſancy</hi> was undoubted, was not for all that baptized till at age, to ſet <hi>a pattern</hi> for us in our <hi>approaches</hi> to that <hi>Ordinance;</hi> then certainly it is an audacious practiſe to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Infants, whoſe <hi>title</hi> to Churchmemberſhip and Diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be made out with parallel clearneſs, and that too, in expreſt diſſonancy to that <hi>great</hi> and moſt <hi>illuſtrious</hi> example of our <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. To argue <hi>from Chriſts headſhip, that Children ſhould be baptized,</hi> is a meer <hi>non-ſequiter.</hi> Chriſt in his Infaney was head of the Church, but not in <hi>acts exercito;</hi> ſo for ought we know Infants may be members of his <hi>Myſtical</hi> hody, yet are no <hi>actual Diſciples,</hi> till they <hi>hear</hi> the Goſpel, and <hi>profeſs</hi> the faith. And <hi>inviſible</hi> Memberſhip, being <hi>uncertain</hi> to us, can be <hi>no ground</hi> for Baptiſm. <hi>Beſides,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> ſays, by this Reaſoning, <hi>an Infant in the womb may be a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble member, becauſe then Chriſt was head of the Church, and an old man ſhould not be a member, for Chriſt was not an old man.</hi> And I may add, that Infants by this argument ſhould be <hi>Prophets, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> in their Infancy, as well as Church-members, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not be haſty to make this <hi>Concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> queries, <hi>are not Infants members of other ſocieties? families? the Kings ſubjects? And why not Chriſts, as well as the Kings?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But I ask Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in whoſe viſible Kingdom are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Infants before Baptiſm. If he ſay in the <hi>Devils;</hi> then he is guilty of the ſame <hi>execrable</hi> Doctrine he charges upon us.

Then how can they be ſaid to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Baptiſm? Is it not <hi>non-ſenſe</hi> to ſay, it enters them into a ſtate they were in before? To let one into a Room, when he is already there, is impoſſble. Nor will the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>incompleat</hi> member ſerve Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> men, or members in <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But if they be <hi>compleat</hi> or perfect members after Baptiſm, why have they not the <hi>ſupper</hi> and <hi>other Ordinances</hi> of the Church adminiſtred to them? If they be ſtill <hi>incompleat,</hi> as before Baptiſm; What benefit have they by Baptiſm, being as lame Members after as before it.</p>
                  <p>Now as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was told, he muſt hold <hi>two firſt entrances into the viſible</hi> Church, viz. <hi>Natural-birth</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> of elſe he muſt hold that Baptiſm is <hi>not the firſt</hi> entrance: Or elſe that Believers Infants are <hi>not entred;</hi> and if not ſo <hi>not in the viſible Church before Baptiſm.</hi> If he ſays the firſt, he,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30081:46"/>contradicts all he ſays of <hi>entring the viſible Church in his Plea againſt the ſeekers,</hi> p. 343. If the ſecond, <hi>He contradicts all he ſays of Baptiſm's being the only entrance:</hi> If the third then of theſe two things he muſt neceſſarily ſay one, viz, Either all the Infants of believers that die (before their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entrance into the viſible Church by Baptiſm, <hi>are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> without hope — (which he dares not aver if he be a Proteſtant) or elſe that they may be in a ſtate of <hi>Salvation</hi> and yet not be <hi>viſible</hi> Members of the Church; let him avoid this if he can. And doth not this ſame Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tell us in his firſt <hi>Book</hi> of Baptiſm p 72. <hi>That it is not the denyal of Baptiſm directly, that leaveth Infants in the viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Devil.</hi> And if he ſtill holds this for a truth, how can he honeſtly exclaim againſt us at this rate, as if our denyal of Baptiſm to them, had damned them all.</p>
                  <p>The text Act. 2.47. <hi>That God added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> is not (as he falſly imagines) to be underſtood of <hi>all</hi> or <hi>only</hi> ſuch, but only <hi>ſuch men,</hi> and <hi>women</hi> (not ſuch <hi>Infants</hi>) as ſhould be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>The impartial conſideration of this, makes his loud talk about our placing <hi>all Infants Unbaptized in the Kingdom of the Devil,</hi> an empty jangle. And if Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that all unbaptized Infants are under that unmercyful and too cruel Character; and that the meer act of external <hi>Baptiſm</hi> tranſlates them to the Kingdom of Chriſt, in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt he dreadfully <hi>preaches</hi> Millions of poor harmleſs ſouls to <hi>Hell</hi> — And in holding the ſecond, he aſcribes more to Baptiſm, then ever God did (<hi>viz.</hi> that it procures ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and differs in nothing from the blaſphemous feats aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the <hi>Pope</hi> to his <hi>opus oparatum</hi>) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>argument</hi> why upon his <hi>Review</hi> he ſees cauſe to plead a freſh for his <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> and that is the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of houſholds.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This argument is over and over anſwered. And is it not ſtrange that the word <hi>(houſhold)</hi> in thoſe few places mentioned muſt <hi>include</hi> Infants, when <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſpoken of: but when the <hi>paſſover</hi> is ſpoken of, then Infants are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,</hi> becauſe elſe we ſhall argue from thence to their <hi>eating the Supper,</hi> as <hi>they from Circumciſion to their Baptiſm?</hi> Do not theſe men force that <hi>ſignification</hi> upon words that beſt ſerve their turn?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> I ſhould weary thee and my ſelf, if I ſhould run over the long-winded Repetitions of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</hi> What I ſaid already if well weighed, Anſwers his tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous talk in the ſucceeding pages. And I think my time more worth then to waſt it in diſproving naked dictates. What becomes of <hi>Heathens</hi> dying Infants, is known only to God, and it is no better then ſinful curioſity to be wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and too confidently obtruding our conceptions about ſuch unrevealed matters. 'Tis certainly the ſafeſt way to be ſober, and advance no further in ſuch <hi>queſts,</hi> then the Scripture <hi>guides.</hi> We have enough revealed to employ our ſtudies upon, and <hi>make us wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15.</p>
                  <p>To enervate our Plea for non-Baptiſing Infants, <hi>viz. the want of Scripture preſident or grecept,</hi> he propound a queſtion to us, thus. <hi>There is no Scripture-preſident for Baptizing Kings (he might add Coblers too) muſt none there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be Baptized?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a gravelling <hi>quere</hi> he thinks. But we find Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preſident for Baptizing <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women.</hi> And in my Judgement <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> and Coblers alſo, are <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſays p. 17. <hi>The Scripture tells us not all that was done, but all that muſt be done.</hi> VVe grant it — And if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us all that muſt be done, and we find not a ſyllable there of Infant Baptiſm; is it not very injurious to blame us for renouncing ſuch a practice as we find no warrant for? This very man tells us, pl. Script. p. 301. <hi>That he finds it a hard Controverſy to prove Infant Baptiſm, it is ſo dark in the Scripture</hi> — And <hi>More Proofs</hi> p. 219. <hi>That it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difficulties, and that his proofs are not ſo clear as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30081:47"/>every good man can perceive</hi> — And yet he has publiſhed a Book Intituled, <hi>plain Scripture-proof for Infant Baptiſm</hi> — ſtrange <hi>conſidence,</hi> and <hi>Contradiction!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now he produces (as he tells us,) <hi>a full command for Infant Baptiſm,</hi> Math. 28.19. <hi>becauſe Nations muſt be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> VVhat ſhall we ſay to men whoſe Judgements are fore ſtalled by a darling error? I need not add much to diſprove this, but referr the Reader to our Books where this text is vindicated from Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſeleſs gloſs. Nations are to be <hi>diſcipled,</hi> and ſo <hi>Baptized,</hi> Certainly the Pronown [then] governed by the participle <hi>[Baptizing]</hi> can poſſibly relate to no other <hi>Subſtantive,</hi> then the <hi>Perſons</hi> commanded before to be taught. For as Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> truly tells us p. 7. <hi>'tis not the Nations in groſs. For then, all muſt be Baptized, if the word Nation univerſally taken doth there denote the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptiſm.</hi> But 'tis the Nations with reſtriction, that is, ſuch as are diſcipled by teaching, and no more, that are commanded to be baptized. And if this be not the ſenſe, they muſt baptize them in the lump, <hi>Heathens, Unbelievers, Profeſſors Infants,</hi> and all, and that whether they would be baptized or nor. Let Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> conſider what a full command he hath met with for his practice.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> further talk <hi>about Infants being Diſciples, and his parity of Reaſon from their being the Kings Subjects; Ergo, why not Chriſts,</hi> I look upon as frivolous. His frequent urge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>parents Faith to be the ground of their Baptiſm, and that the Parents will go for theirs in conſenting, ſhall be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered in the words of a learned Doctor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>If they have <hi>imputative</hi> faith, ſo let the <hi>Sacrament</hi> be too; that is, if they have the <hi>Parents</hi> faith, or the <hi>Churches,</hi> then ſo let <hi>Baptiſm</hi> be imputed to them by derivation from them, and as in their mothers womb, and while they hang on their mother breaſts, they live upon their mothers nouriſhments; ſo they may upon the Baptiſm of their parents or their mother the Church; For ſince faith is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the ſuſception of Baptiſm (and they themſelves confeſs it by ſtriving to find out <hi>new kinds of Faith</hi> to daub the matter up) <hi>ſuch</hi> as the Faith, <hi>ſuch</hi> muſt be the Sacrament; for there is no proportion betwen an <hi>actual</hi> Sacrament, and an <hi>Imputative</hi> faith; this being an immediate and neceſſary order to that. And whatſoever can be ſaid to take of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30081:47"/>neceſſity of actual faith, all that and much more may be ſaid to excuſe from the actual ſuſception of Baptiſm, &amp;c. <hi>And a little further he adds</hi> — That if baptiſm be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſalvation of Infants (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> of old, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſince) [yea and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> too] upon whom is the impoſition laid? to whom is the Command given? to the Parents, or the Children? Not to the Parents; for then God hath put the ſalvation of innocent babes into the power of others; and Infants may be damned for their parents careleſneſs or malice. It follows that it is not neceſſary at all to be done unto them, to whom it cannot be preſcribed as a Law, and in whoſe behalf it cannot be reaſonably intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others, with the appendant neceſſity: And if it be not neceſſary, it is certain it is not reaſonable, and moſt certain it is no where in terms preſcribed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is preſumed that Baptiſm ought to be underſtood and adminiſtred according as other precepts are, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the capacity of the ſubject, and the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the thing.</p>
                     <p>And again — If any man runs for ſuccour to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded <hi>Cresphugeton,</hi> that Infants have faith, or any other inſpired habit of I know not what, and how; we deſire no more advantage in the world, then that they are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to anſwer, without <hi>Revelation,</hi> againſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> common <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and all the <hi>experience</hi> in the world. <hi>Haec ille.</hi>

                     <hi>Reader,</hi> I take Mr. <hi>Baxters Review</hi> hitherto to be ſhewed vain, and his ground for <hi>Paedo-baptiſm</hi> to be very weak and frivolous. He comes next p. 20 to add and enlarge upon 4 <hi>particulars,</hi> and thoſe ſubdivided into many others, which comprehend the reſt of the <hi>Review.</hi>

                  <p>By way of digreſſion, before he comes to the fourth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30081:48"/>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> quarrels with Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> for deſiring him <hi>to repent of his abſurd poſition of a Baptiſmal Covenant of grace running in a fleſhly line,</hi> and ſeems to <hi>deny</hi> that ever he uſed ſuch a phraſe, but if he remembers himſelf, he uſes the words <hi>[baptiſmal Covenant]</hi> frequently, as <hi>More Proofs,</hi> p. 198. 224. 238. even in this <hi>Review</hi> p. 3. &amp; 38.

If that be not his meaning, why doth he not tell us what <hi>other Covenant</hi> he means?

Doth he not call our Diſpute againſt this conceit, <hi>a Hectoring men out of their Inheritances, Review</hi> p. 34? which fully explains what Covenant he means: it ſeems he dares not own his opinion, when <hi>ſtated</hi> in the <hi>proper</hi> terms, but would mince it into a more diſguiſed and <hi>ſpecious</hi> Phraſe, to impoſe with the more <hi>artifice</hi> upon his <hi>credulous can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The reſt of his talk better deſerves thoſe titles of <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious,</hi> and inſulting, and <hi>Rhetorical invective canting,</hi> &amp;c. which he beſtows upon his <hi>admoniſher,</hi> then the <hi>Letter</hi> ſent him.</p>

Direct. p. 156. <hi>How know you whether the thing reported is true? Is it only becauſe a credible perſon ſpoke it? But how did that perſon know it to be true? might not he take it upon truſt as well as you? and might he not think a perſon to be credible

                  <p>You ſay, <hi>you are paſt doubt that you have read of their Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing naked in Forreign writers,</hi> p. 53.

                  <p>But what need I ſay any more hereto, ſince Mr. D. has in ſo many particulars (in his 3. Reply) ſo ſubſtantially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected your falacy and falſhood herein, diſcovering that all your endeavours to extricate your ſelf, has but involved you into ſurther guilt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Sir, ſuffer me in conjunction with your other Monitors, earneſtly to exhort you to Review &amp; lay to heart this your ſlanderous way of writing, and be prevailed with once in your life to retract ſome of your bad, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, amongſt other of your calumnies, let not your ſlanderous Reviling of the Vaniſts and Anabaptiſts be forgotten by you. And in the mean time, that you'l ceaſe juſtifying or palliating ſuch impieties which will do nothing but inhance your reckoning in the day of Accompt.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you have long abuſed the world, too apt of it ſelf to receive opinions upon the <hi>bare</hi> (though <hi>miſtaken</hi>) reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of ſuch voluminous <hi>triflers</hi> as you. And I am perſwaded ſeveral of your <hi>proſelites</hi> have ſuckt in your corrupt Notions,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30081:53"/>(without any ſerious examination of your reaſons) meerly becauſe you ſaid ſo. And therefore what Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tully,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crandon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> and ſeveral other learned men have writ to detect your corruptions, is, in my judgement, very good ſervice; that you may not under your diſguiſe of piety, learning, and purity, longer infect the Nation with that dangerous leaven your books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with. And if men will ſtill, after ſuch fair warning, make you the <hi>Oracle</hi> of their Divinity, let them blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only if they find the effects of it malignant and perillous.</p>
                  <p>'Tis like you can write <hi>another Book</hi> (at leaſt <hi>a Poſtſcript</hi>) if you be in the humor, to conſute all we ſay; and that you'l call what I ſay to you, <hi>Quaker-like oratory and obteſtations,</hi> and that 'tis in <hi>hypocriſie</hi> (as you tell Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> though you boldly aſſume a prerogative, that belongs not to you, of <hi>judging the heart</hi>) and 'tis probable you'l ſtill <hi>out-face</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his <hi>large Demonſtrations,</hi> with <hi>Poſtſcripts</hi> containing <hi>general exclamations</hi> and <hi>dictates,</hi> and belike you think your <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> is of as uncontroll'd authority as that of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> — But Sir, 'tis my preſent intention to give you leave to talk, till you talk your ſelf quiet: <hi>for there's no gaping againſt an Oven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I can (if you will but hear it) cure your pretended ignorance, why people talk <hi>of your averſeneſs to martyrdom.</hi> And 'tis not (as you would inſinuate) <hi>becauſe we judge all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons graceleſs, that are not Martyred,</hi> (for ſo we judge them not) <hi>nor that you may be capable enough of our good opinion though unmartyred;</hi> nor do we <hi>mock at Paul for being let down by the wall in a Basket; nor at our bleſſed Saviours withdrawing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egipt, into the Wilderneſs, or</hi> Galilee; which you would ſain make examples in your caſe — But Sir, it is becauſe you have given too large an experience, that you can conform to whatever <hi>mode</hi> of worſhip is <hi>uppermoſt</hi> in the Nation, at leaſt ſo far, as to ſtave off ſuffering And that you are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with words to ſuch a degree, as to <hi>out-face</hi> all the world, that they muſt take you as their <hi>exampler</hi> in Religion.

                  <p>MR. <hi>Walker</hi>'s <hi>Modeſt Plea for Infant Baptiſm</hi> coming to hand, whilſt thoſe Papers were delay'd at the Preſs, I thought fit to ſay ſomething to it; yet ſhall obſerve my wonted <hi>brevity:</hi> and the rather becauſe his Arguments (as he ſays, p. 425.) <hi>are moſtly thoſe that were uſed by Dr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>and Dr.</hi> Hammond, now <hi>fitted by him for vulgar capacity.</hi> As for Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Perſon, or the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of his Reaſoning, let his <hi>Liberty of Prophecy</hi> determine, whether he has not given <hi>Paedobaptiſm</hi> ſuch a <hi>wound,</hi> as neither he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor any other of that perſwaſion, (no not Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf) were, or ever will be, able to cure. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he urged againſt us <hi>afterwards,</hi> (which was but very <hi>faint</hi> too) is upon record ſubſtantially <hi>confuted</hi> by his own pen. As to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Arguments, they are largely and learnedly refelled by Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> in the later <hi>Sections</hi> of the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> part of his <hi>Review,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſhould have taken notice of; and to which the <hi>enquiring Reader</hi> is now <hi>referred.</hi>

                  <p>As to the <hi>matter</hi> of his Book, it is confeſs'd, his labour in quoting ſo many <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authorities, has not been <hi>ſmall;</hi> (And Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> before him gave through every Century a collection of their <hi>real,</hi> as <hi>pretended</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities:) And I confeſs freely, that he hath <hi>much more</hi> to pretend from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> then thoſe have who aſſert Infant Baptiſm from a <hi>faederal right,</hi> a <hi>Medium</hi> not to be found among the Fathers, nor in the world (as I can find) till about <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his time in the 16th. <hi>Century.</hi> For all the Fathers that held the Baptiſm of Infants, for theſe laſt 1200 years it has been in the world, have aſſerted it [and <hi>Voſſius</hi> himſelf ſays, that <hi>it was the mind of the Catholick Church, Magnus eſt (antiquitatis) conſenſus, quod — Infantes per baptiſmum vitae ac felicitatis aeternae participes fiant,</hi> p. 594.] from its <hi>neceſſity</hi> to <hi>ſalvation.</hi> Which <hi>diſmal</hi> opinion grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common, that <hi>none without baptiſm could be ſaved,</hi> from <hi>John</hi> 3.5. miſ-underſtood; and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens <hi>ſalvation,</hi> having ſo near an <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>impreſſion</hi> upon them, cauſed them to admit a concluſion of ſo great <hi>moment</hi> and concernment, upon very <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>infirm</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.

                  <p>By way of <hi>premiſe,</hi> and to prevent Repetition, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how far the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> (ſo much lean'd upon by Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and others) is obliging to us, and of what <hi>weight</hi> their Teſtimonies ought to be, in <hi>deciding</hi> this Controverſie. And I ſhall lay this down for a principle, which no man I preſume will deny, — <hi>That Proofs ought to be fetcht from ſuch things as are confeſs'd and acknowledged by our adverſary whom we endeavour to convince, otherwiſe we ſhall never be able to move him, or make him quit his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion.</hi> And therefore no proof from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to prove a matter of <hi>right,</hi> is valid againſt us, becauſe we <hi>own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30081:56"/>carry with it, a ſufficient authority to ſatisfie the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which neither can, nor indeed ought to believe any thing in point of Religion, (as the excellent <hi>Daille</hi> at large evinces) but what it knows to be <hi>certainly</hi> true.

For to what purpoſe is it to find that the Ancients believed it, unleſs we find withall in their writings, ſome reaſon of this their belief? and what harm is it to us to be ignorant, whether Antiquity believed it, or not, ſo long as we know that the thing is? <hi>Quod ſacris Scripturis traditum non eſt, non ſine peccato inquiritur, ſive periculo ignoratur,</hi> ſays <hi>Bull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The greateſt admirers of the Fathers confeſs, that though they erre little in matter of <hi>right,</hi> yet are often out, and have their failings in matter of <hi>fact,</hi> becauſe <hi>right</hi> is an univerſal thing, every way uniform, and all of one ſort, whereas matter of <hi>fact</hi> is a thing which is mixt, and as it were enchas'd with divers particular circumſtances, which may eaſily eſcape the obſervation and knowledge of (or at leaſt be not ſo rightly underſtood by) the moſt clear and piercing wits. Now the condition of the Churches belief in every particular age, is matter of <hi>fall,</hi> and not <hi>right,</hi> and a point of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> not an Article of Faith. He that will not examine the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> as well as the <hi>Opinions</hi> of men, (though of never ſo <hi>venerable</hi> names) may be ſoon led into a <hi>laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> of error. How conſonant to Reaſon is it, that we ſhould alledge, not the <hi>Names</hi> of Books, but the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and take notice not of the <hi>quality</hi> of their Authors, but of the <hi>ſolidity</hi> of their proofs, ſo to reduce the diſpute from <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to <hi>things,</hi> according to that memorable ſaying of <hi>Jerom,</hi> Ep. 15. <hi>Non juxta Pytagorae Diſcipulos, praejudicata doctoris opinio, ſed doctrinae ratio ponderanda eſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is urged here is to reduce Controverſies to be tried before the <hi>right bar,</hi> viz. the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſince that alone is of ſo ſacred and undoubted authority as to oblige our belief, to whatever is found there; and againſt which no objections lie, the Lord having by his gracious providence preſerved them in the Church from the injuries of time, ignorance, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30081:57"/>fraud, from the beginning hitherto. They have been kept with much <hi>greater</hi> care, then any other Books, tranſlated into <hi>all Languages,</hi> retained both by <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> diligently obſerving each other, ſo that there could not poſſibly happen any remarkable alteration in them, but that preſently the whole world would have exclaimed againſt it; whereas (as learned <hi>Daille</hi> truly ſays) much of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that go under the names of the Fathers, are not truly <hi>ſach,</hi> and that the Hereticks vented their conceits under thoſe eminent names, to gain them <hi>repute;</hi> And that their legitimate pieces are wonderfully <hi>corrupted</hi> and <hi>obſcure,</hi> (and ſuch are not proper for the deciſion of Controverſies) and incumbred with Rhetorical <hi>flouriſhes,</hi> and Legical <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties;</hi> and that they have <hi>erred</hi> in divers points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and <hi>contradicted</hi> one another in matters of <hi>great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</hi> So that in this caſe we are to take the courſe that's obſerved in all Sciences whatſoever; we are to prove the truth we propoſe by ſuch <hi>maximes</hi> as are acknowledg'd and allow'd, making good that which is <hi>doubtfull,</hi> by that which is <hi>certain;</hi> and clearing that which is <hi>ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

No Science gives us any certain account of <hi>Negative Propoſitions,</hi> for as much as to go about to number them all, would be both an <hi>infinite,</hi> and alſo an <hi>unprofitable, uſeleſs</hi> piece of work: Therefore ſuch as go about to eſtabliſh an opinion, becauſe not <hi>expreſly</hi> forbidden in Scripture, (as Mr <hi>Walker</hi> ſeems to do. p. 218. whoſe words are, <hi>Never ſtand hunting for a Scripture for it, ſo long as there is no Scripture againſt it)</hi> do not conſider that they undermine the <hi>ſecureſt</hi> ground we ſtand upon, againſt the invaders of Religion: For by that argument (as Dr <hi>Owen</hi> well ſays) <hi>ten thouſand things may it made lawfull,</hi> there being no expreſs Scripture ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the upſtart <hi>inventions,</hi> and <hi>impoſtures</hi> of Seducers by name and circumſtance. And what a croud of ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions have crept into the worſhip of God, under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, in times of Superſtition, under the Antichriſtian ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude!</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:30081:57"/>

And be it noted by the way, that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays the Arguments from this Text are <hi>imperfect ways of probation,</hi> ſect. 23. of his Reſol. to 6 <hi>Queries</hi> about <hi>Infant Bapt.</hi> whoſe word ſhould do much with Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi> He that would evince that this Text is a ſufficient foundation for the fabrick of <hi>Paedobptiſm,</hi> ſhould have proved, that there is <hi>no other way</hi> of coming unto Chriſt but <hi>by Baptiſm;</hi> or that Chriſt, or his Diſciples, <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally baptized</hi> theſe children; or that the <hi>bleſſing</hi> in the Text is <hi>baptizing.</hi> 'Tis true, we have an <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> from Mr. <hi>W.</hi> p. 19. that <hi>there can be no other way of their coming to Chriſt, but by Baptiſm;</hi> but he cannot blame us if we rely not upon his authority in ſo material a point.</p>
                  <p>Now if thoſe things be not clearly demonſtrated, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſequence will flow from this Text, that Infants ought to be baptized; and if it will not certainly follow, what rational man dares build his belief upon a foundation ſo <hi>uncertain,</hi> and that in oppoſition both to that plain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and example we have for adult baptiſm. But this is ſo far from certainty, that there is not the leaſt ſhew of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that our Saviour did (or intended to) baptize them. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath no other way to bring Infants to himſelf, but by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is a ſpeech too harſh, if not bordering upon blaſphemy; therefore Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſhould recall what he ſays that is liable to ſuch an Interpretation: for if it were ſo, then doubtleſs our Saviour would have ordered thoſe children to be baptized, for whoſe approach unto him he was pleaſed to expreſs ſo much willingneſs. So that as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> notes very pertinently, p. 230. <hi>Lib. Proph.</hi> we <q>may ſay, that from the action of Chriſts bleſſing Infants, to infer that they were baptized, proves nothing ſo much, as that there is a <hi>want</hi> of better arguments; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion would with more probability be derived thus: <hi>Chriſt</hi> bleſſed children, and ſo diſmiſſed them, but bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed them not; therefore Infants are <hi>not</hi> to be baptized. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not baptize them, is an argument ſufficient, that he hath <hi>other</hi> ways of bringing them to <hi>Heaven</hi> then by Baptiſm. Many thouſand ways there are by which <hi>God</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:30081:61"/>can bring any reaſonable ſoul to him, but nothing is more unreaſonable, then becauſe he hath tyed all men of years and diſcretion to this way, therefore we of our own heads, ſhall carry Infants to him that way without his direction: the conceit is poor and low, and the action conſequent to it, bold and venturous; let him do what he pleaſes with Infants, we muſt not.</q>

                  <p>And what <hi>warrant</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has to wreſt this word out of the ſignification the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> conſtantly puts upon it, to countenance ſuch a Diſcipleſhip as is no better then a meer conceit, (or <hi>ens rationis</hi>) is more then I can imagine.

                  <p>He ſays p. 24. <hi>That a Conſequence from Scripture rightly made, is a ground good enough to bear any weight that can be fairly laid upon it, and as valid to all intents and purpoſes as if it were expreſs Scripture it ſelf, that being eminently contained in the Scripture, whatever it be that may be fairly drawn from it.</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30081:62"/>obſcure Rule of Faith.

                  <p>It is to be bewail'd what conviction proof men are, even in ſo plain a caſe; has not common (and wofull) <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> taught us, that when ſuch a liberty of allowing Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, and Opinions from pretended Conſequences, was moſt encouraged, that Religion was then <hi>moſt incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi> (yea ſtifled) with the products of ſuch wanton wits as play'd the <hi>Sophiſters</hi> with Scripture, and obtruded ſuch <hi>Brats</hi> of their <hi>own begetting,</hi> as legitimate off-ſprings of the Word, upon the too much <hi>abuſed</hi> and <hi>credulous</hi> Vulgar, to the miſleading of their Souls, and foſtering, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating, Diviſion and Confuſion in the Church? whereas of right, <hi>no products of an humane ſpirit, ſhould be receiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Evangelical Religion.</hi> Therefore in my opinion 'tis the ſafeſt way to be <hi>ſober</hi> in a matter of ſuch high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and admit of no <hi>conſequence</hi> in point of <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>practice,</hi> that are <hi>obſcure, doubtfull,</hi> or <hi>uncertain,</hi> but only ſuch as are <hi>plain,</hi> and to be eaſily ſeen by any eye to be the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>undoubted reſult</hi> of the <hi>premiſſes,</hi> and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the general <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>tenour</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> his demand, <hi>who ſhall be Judge to determine which conſequences are plain, and which not?</hi> is a captious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, propounded only to make a noiſe; for the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation lies againſt all conſequences, viz. <hi>who ſhall Judge, what conſequences are rightly deduced, and what not?</hi> which, (when he reſolves it for himſelf) reſolves the other alſo for us. 'Tis certain, that every mans <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>diſcretive Judgment,</hi> muſt in that caſe be his Judge, no other being inveſted into that <hi>Supremacy.</hi> 'Tis true, that appears plain to one; which appears not ſo to another, therefore we are to pray for a diſcerning and clear <hi>underſtanding,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30081:64"/>Jam.</hi> 1.17. that we might be eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Evangelical Truths,</hi> without being beholden to the <hi>niceties</hi> of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and their <hi>idle ſpeculations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon this point, becauſe we are generally charged to deny <hi>all Conſequences</hi> from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is falſe; for we grant that after the example of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Apoſtle, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32 <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33, 34. we may from <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>lawfull</hi> premiſſes, infer their <hi>neceſſary Concluſion.</hi> The thing we deny is, that ſuch <hi>Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, pretended Conſequences,</hi> (not at all countenanced in Scripture Text) as our adverſaries uſe in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Controverſie of Infant Baptiſm againſt us, are of any validity or credit, and ſhould not therefore be uſed.</p>
                  <p>It may be well called the <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> that (a late <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pen</hi> hath ſo <hi>feelingly</hi> expreſt) <q>There is nothing has prov'd a greater plague to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> then <hi>School-Divinity;</hi> where new queſtions, nice diſtinctions, and raſh concluſions, are toſs'd up and down like <hi>Tennis-balls,</hi> whence proceed cruel bickerings and dangerous Hereſies. The firſt Divinity School we read of, was ſet up at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> by <hi>Pantenus,</hi> whence ſprung the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie, which ſoon overran all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> In the ſubtilty of thoſe <hi>Schools</hi> Hereſie grew <hi>refined,</hi> and with their diſtinctions and evaſions quite baffled the plain and ſimple profeſſors of the Goſpel. There is no giving way to rational De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions and humane Argumentations, againſt Faith and Scripture. The Primitive <hi>Doctors</hi> converted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm and well skill'd in <hi>Philoſophy, Antiquity, Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> tranſlated thoſe Sciences (falſly ſo called) into Chriſtianity, to illuſtrate by their indiſcreet zeal, and imbelliſh Chriſtian knowledge by Artificial forms and figures, but rather deſaced it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. That the <hi>Greeks</hi> fond of niceties, tranſplanted their beloved Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical flowers into Chriſtian Gardens, which prov'd indeed <hi>Weeds. Haec ille.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>So that the concluſion I ſhall in this particular come to, is, <hi>That we are not under the notion of Conſequence to admit any thing in point of Religion, but what is of ſuch clear and undoubted Scripture demonſtration, as might ſatisfie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that it is the Will of God; And that we are to uſe all endeavours to reſcue Chriſtianity from thoſe incumbrances of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30081:64"/>humane inventions and Traditions, which the wanton and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Schoolmen have mixt with it; and ſo reduce it to its primitive purity and ſimplicity, by adhering cloſe to the Word of God, and rejecting all thoſe corrupt gloſſes, that under the title of explaining, render it indeed more obſcure, unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible and confounding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Arguments from the <hi>benefits of Infant Baptiſm,</hi> which he ſays are an <hi>early Conſecration</hi> — being <hi>brought thereby into Covenant — under a Vow — and others care — united to Chriſt — made thereby Children of God — heirs of Heaven — partakers of Grace — conſigned to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection — are ſaved by it — freed from Original ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they are all,</hi> in the notion Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> holds them, <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and exploded (for the moſt part) by our <hi>learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> as vain and idle conceits. Inſomuch that 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for me to ſpend time in diſproof of that which is ſo fully done already. For what tendency has this kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, but to aſcribe that vertue to the bare application of an Ordinance, which the Lord never gave to it, and ſo ſet up an <hi>Opus Operatum,</hi> which the Proteſtant Churches vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently diſclaim?</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his <hi>Theologomena,</hi> lib. 6. c. 5. p. 477, &amp;c. has excellently refelled this poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> Regeneration by Baptiſm <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> concluding with this verdict of it; <hi>Neque ſanè dogma pernicioſius, aut quod peccatorum animis praeſentius venenum propinaret, facilè excogitaret ipſe menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum pater. — That the very Father of lyes could not eaſily invent a more pernicious opinion, or which might inſtill a more deadly poiſon into the hearts of ſinners.</hi> And then very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply diſcovers, <hi>how all are born in ſin, being children of wrath by nature; and that Regeneration is effected by the Spirit, through the Word in the hearts of believers according to the New Covenant, and not by theſe Popiſh Inventions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the ſame Judgment with Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> herein, were our firſt impugners of Popery the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> in their Treatiſe of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> writ (as is ſaid) by <hi>Peter Bruys</hi> Anno 1120.

So <hi>Rogers</hi> in his <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> p 167, 168. tells us in behalf of the Church of <hi>England, We condemn the Opinion of the</hi> Ruſſe is, <hi>that there is ſuch a neceſſity of Baptiſm, that all that dye without it, are damned.</hi> Reverend Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on <hi>Gal</hi> 2. Vol. 2. Edit. 1617. p. 191, &amp;c. tells us, <q>That the outward waſhing doth not make any man a member of Chriſt, — that Baptiſm is not of abſolute neceſſity, — that Adoption and Life, begin not in Baptiſm, but before, — that a Sacrament hath not the grace of God tyed to it, or ſhut up in it, — but is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to which grace is preſent in the right uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; — that this Doctrine (<hi>viz.</hi> that a Sacrament confers grace by the work done) is a fiction of the brain of man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 21. — that Regeneration is a work of Creation, therefore it is of God immediately, and not immediately from the Sacrament.</q> And much more to this effect, but 'tis too tedious to tranſcribe it, therefore I refer to the Book it ſelf, which notably confutes this conceit.</p>
                  <p>Yet to add <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> I ſhall cite one more as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm; it is Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> p. 150. <hi>Infant Bapt.</hi> who to give him his due, ſpeaks notably to it; <hi>If Baptiſm</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, and that Regeneration is affixt to it, and none can be ſaved without it, then it is in mans power to ſave and to deſtroy; If they will baptize their children, they may ſave them; if they neglect it, damn them, which is horrible abſurdity to conceive.</hi> And in the next page makes out very well, <hi>that Baptiſm is not at all concerned in</hi> John 13.5. <hi>but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30081:65"/>Regeneration;</hi> and in ſo doing proves himſelf to be more <hi>Orthodox</hi> in that particular, then all his Antiquity for <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi> who all of them expounded that Text of external baptiſm, though very abſurdly. But what need I particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize <hi>a few,</hi> when the whole ſtream of the Reformed Writers exclaim with one conſent againſt this Doctrine, and bend much of their labours to refell it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> indeed ſays, as p. 113. <hi>That it hath not any Phyſical vertue in it ſelf, in the way of a Natural cauſe to effect Salvation:</hi> But the very Papiſts ſay ſo much, for no man will be ſo ridiculous as to aſſert it a <hi>Natural</hi> cauſe of ſalvation, and I am certain the Papiſts ſay no more, then Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> when he tells us, <hi>that Baptiſm ſaves Infants,</hi> as p. 108. <hi>That it muſt needs make our Hell the more hot to find our unbaptized children there,</hi> p. 147. <hi>That the baptized are reſcued wholly, or in a great meaſure, from Original ſin,</hi> p. 150. <hi>No Baptiſm, then no Son of God, and then no Heir of his,</hi> p. 153. <hi>No Baptiſm, no entrance even for Infants into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> &amp;c. p 154. <hi>None were ſaved without the Ark; ſo none, that we are ſure of, are ſaved without Baptiſm; — What need Infants have of Salvation, the ſame they have of Baptiſm for their Salvation,</hi> p. 156. calls an <hi>Unbaptized ſtate a damnable ſtate,</hi> p. 142. with much more to that effect. And pray what's all this but an <hi>Opus Operatum?</hi> or a <hi>tying</hi> the <hi>Grace of God</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> I know not that the Papiſts ſay any more then Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> p. 113. viz. <hi>that it hath a ſaving efficacy for ſuch end communicated by God to it,</hi> &amp;c. but I would fain learn of Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> who made him acquainted with that part of Gods counſel; for I could never yet find it in the Bible, that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was dignified with ſo tranſcendent an <hi>energy,</hi> as (in <hi>disjunction</hi> from <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſo 'tis in all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants) to effect Salvation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, to a qualified ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> a penitent Believer, the Lord has made it an Inſtrument, through which he conveys the ſaving communications of his Grace; and to ſuch it is neceſſary (not <hi>abſolutè,</hi> but) <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> becauſe God commanded it. Yet the want of it, where it may not be had, damus not; though the contempt of it, is a horrible affront to the Divine Majeſty, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a dangerous ſin. But 'tis not neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii,</hi> ſince ſalvation, which is the end, may be had without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30081:66"/>it; as in the eaſe of the <hi>Thief upon the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. But to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants it is no way neceſſary; (1) tis not ſo <hi>neceſſitate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti,</hi> becauſe Chriſt <hi>no where</hi> commanded ſuch to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; nor (2) <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> becauſe Chriſt <hi>no where</hi> appointed it to be the means of their ſalvation. We have ſeveral paſſages in Scripture, that give us encouragement of the ſalvation of dying Infants, through the rich grace and tender mercy of him, who is (we hope) their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer as well as ours. But I have in my Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 16. touched upon this point.</p>
                  <p>Next Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in 5 <hi>Chapters</hi> labours to ſhew, <hi>that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not incapable of Baptiſm;</hi> but his Reaſons are not convincing to me, nor do I believe they can be ſo to any, that with an unprejudiced mind, reads our Books; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is amply made out, that Infants are not capable ſubjects of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> no more then of other <hi>Church Ordinances,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want <hi>Faith and Repentance,</hi> as the <hi>Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> informs us; and which the ſame Book tells us, is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of perſons to be baptized.</hi> Neither will the <hi>Sureties profeſſion</hi> for the Child ſerve the turn, for we find no ſuch practice allow'd of, or ſo much as mentioned in Scripture. Neither by any Law of God or man, is ſuch a diſpenſation granted, that a <hi>ſubſtitution</hi> of another's Faith, ſhould ſupply the <hi>deſect</hi> of the perſon to be baptized: Nor does the Child give them any <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to believe for him, nor can they perform, what they promiſe, which is no leſs then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the great and principal graces of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, viz. <hi>Faith and Repentance,</hi> which are the peculiar gifts of God. But I ſhall diſmiſs this particular, referring Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> to Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> his <hi>Juſt Reply,</hi> p. 105. Printed 1675. where by way of <hi>Animadverſion</hi> on that part of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> he confutes this practice <hi>unanſwerably;</hi> And Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Treat. p. 83, 84. and 218, 219, 220. where it is alſo refelled by ſubſtantial, and yet <hi>unanſwered,</hi> Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>It is an inconſiderate expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> to ſay, p. 203 <hi>That in this argument of twiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You know what a ſhort Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion was required of the <hi>Eunuch, Act</hi> 8.37. <hi>If thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt with all thy heart</hi> (ſays <hi>Philip) thou mayſt.</hi> The profeſſion of which ſhort Creed, qualified him (being by that a Diſciple fit) for Baptiſm. But was there no need (think you) of any further teaching? Yes doubtleſs, he had need of Inſtruction in the <hi>practical</hi> Duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity afterwards. So that the words are thus eaſily vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from <hi>Tautology,</hi> for they run <hi>Paraphraſtically</hi> thus: As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid, Go diſciple the Nations, that is (as <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. more <hi>plainly</hi> delivered) preach the Goſpel to every Creature, and baptize ſuch as are ſo diſcipled by your preaching, and when they are admitted into Church Communion, teach them to obſerve all my Commands. See here (as plain, as if writ with the Sun beams) that the firſt teaching is, what they ſhould <hi>believe,</hi> and the next teaching is, what they ſhould <hi>doe;</hi> Faith being neceſſary to admit them <hi>into</hi> the Church, and a holy Converſation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep them <hi>there.</hi> And that this is the genuine meaning and Interpretation, we need no other proof then the Apoſtles practice purſuant to it, who preach'd <hi>firſt, then</hi> baptized, and <hi>then</hi> taught too. Firſt they gathered Churches by <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>baptizing,</hi> and then <hi>preach'd</hi> to them ſo <hi>gathered;</hi> the firſt preaching for <hi>Converſion,</hi> the other for <hi>Confirmation</hi> and further <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> a teaching <hi>à priori</hi> in order to Diſcipleſhip and Baptiſm, and a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>à poſteriori</hi> in order to Perfection. Baptiſm is to be by precept immediately <hi>after</hi> the firſt, and the other by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo immediately <hi>after</hi> Baptiſm, which is walled in on <hi>both ſides</hi> by teaching, that Infants are univerſally excluded, till they be capable of being taught.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. in the verſe before <hi>preaching is before baptizing, — The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ye the way of the Lord.</hi> — And 'tis abſurd to imagine that a man can be baptized before he be preach'd unto; for then he ſhould be baptized, into he knows not what.</p>

                  <p>What Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> urges from the lying <hi>Talmud,</hi> (as the learned Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull</hi> calls it in his <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> p. 315) to evince that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> in the initiation of Proſelytes, is of no force againſt us, who receive not their Cuſtom as Goſpel, nor durſt we practice Infant <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> which is no <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> from <hi>Jewiſh principles,</hi> it having been never appointed by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, but corruptly aroſe with Infant Communion, from a conceit of neceſſity, as is already evident.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> proceeds to argue, p. 292. that Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is an <hi>Apoſtolical practice,</hi> for which he urges the <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of houſholds;</hi> but what I have ſaid to Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> about this, may alſo ſerve here.

                  <p>In that old Tranſlation of the Bible, (done by <hi>John Rogers</hi> the Martyr, as ſaith <hi>Holingſhed</hi> in his Chron, p. 1168.) we find in the Notes upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. theſe words, viz. <hi>Not that children are clean and pure by nature, for that were againſt the Apoſtle himſelf, who proveth</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>that all are under Original ſin, and naturally the children of wrath, as</hi> Eph. 2. <hi>But his meaning is, that like as all things are clean to the clean, ſo that he may be converſant with her, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſend in ſo doing; and that the children of them are not to be reputed as unlawful and unclean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Dilemma</hi> p. 329. is <hi>nugatory,</hi> and will directly lye againſt themſelves in many points of <hi>Popery</hi> they reject. And his enumeration of things believed, yet not expreſly delivered in Scripture, is frivolous: for we deny not, but <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> may be right, if prov'd by <hi>good conſequence,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:30081:70"/>(yet it is certain, that the only Rule in <hi>Sacraments</hi> is the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and <hi>practice</hi>) but we deny the conſequences produced for it, to be <hi>good.</hi> So that it is not conſequences, but <hi>pretended, abſurd,</hi> and <hi>illogical</hi> conſequences we deny, therefore his diſcourſe being be ſides our practice, is inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. 'Tis a very bold, and dangerous practice, to ſet up any Invention of our own in Religion, under pretence of its being agreeable to Gods ſecret will, (as Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> talks) for who can tell whether it be ſo, or no? Methinks <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abibu</hi>'s tragical end <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. ſhould teach ſuch, what they are to expect for preſumptions of that kind.</p>
                  <p>The Argument p. 338. is a weak one and will prove the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. to be no ſin, as well as <hi>Inſant Baptiſm.</hi> But that it is a ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a tranſgreſſion of a Law, may be thus demonſtrated; That which is done beſides (and without any warrant from) the Doctrine and practice of the Law-giver, is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Law: But <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> is ſuch; therefore a tranſgreſſion of a Law, and conſequently a ſin. The major is apparent from that maxim received among Proteſtants, and by which they defend themſelves againſt Papiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>in poſitive Worſhip whatſoever is not commanded, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</hi> The minor is proved at large in our Writings.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> diſcourſe, as where he affirms, that <hi>Infant Baptiſm might be lawfull, though there were neither command for it, nor example of it,</hi> as p. 331. is not only againſt us, but againſt all the <hi>Reformers:</hi> for, if ſuch a Doctrine were believed, what a gap would it open for all <hi>Tradition-mongers,</hi> to break in, and impoſe what they pleaſe upon us? that pretence being as allowable in all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded points, as in this; therefore I believe all that make the Scriptures the <hi>Standard</hi> to try Doctrines by, will be of our ſide in this caſe, therefore at preſent I think it needleſs to ſay any thing more to it.</p>
                  <p>What Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſay, in Reply to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> made to the <hi>Objection</hi> from no <hi>expreſs Command or Example in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of womens receiving the Lords Supper,</hi> is not <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> nor does it prove that there is as good conſequence for <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> as <hi>womens</hi> receiving the Supper; And he taking no notice of what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſo fully writ about that matter, to Mr. <hi>Blinman,</hi> p. 177. 1 Reply, it is enough to refer him thither; and to Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> his <hi>Juſt Reply,</hi> p. 96.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30081:70"/>As to his defence p. 409. of thoſe <hi>ſpurious Books aſcribed to Juſtine Martyr, Dionyſius the Areopagite,</hi> &amp;c. mentioned before, being all that's produced for that practice for the firſt 300 years, it is meerly inſignificant, he having not anſwered what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> urged with undeniable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to prove them fabulous, as Treat. p. 98, &amp;c. and 136, &amp;c. So that what I ſaid before, with this Reference, is enough as to that particular. And therefore at preſent I ſhall ſay no more but this, (with Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi>) That if any perſon be deceived by thoſe arguments urged for <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> after ſo full a diſcovery of the futility of them for theſe 30 or 40 years paſt, we may conclude, that <hi>they are deceived, becauſe they are willing to be deceived.</hi>
